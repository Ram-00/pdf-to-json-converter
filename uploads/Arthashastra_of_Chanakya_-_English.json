THE END OF SCIENCES.\nDetermination of the place of Anvikshaki.\nANVIKSHAKI, the triple V\u00e9das (Trayi), V\u00e1rta (agriculture,\ncattle-breeding and trade), and Danda-Niti (science of\ngovernment) are what are called the four sciences.\nThe school of Manu (Manava) hold that there are only three\nsciences: the triple Vedas, Varta and the science of government,\n8",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\ninasmuch as the science of Anvikshaki is nothing but a special\nbranch of the Vedas.\nThe school of Brihaspati say that there are only two sciences:\nVarta and the science of government, inasmuch as the Triple\nVedas are merely an abridgment (Samvarana, pretext?) for a man\nexperienced in affairs temporal (Lokayatravidah).\nThe school of Usanas declare that there is only one science,\nand that the science of government; for, they say, it is in that\nscience that all other sciences have their origin and end.\nBut Kautilya holds that four and only four are the sciences;\nwherefore it is from these sciences that all that concerns\nrighteousness and wealth is learnt, therefore they are so called.\nAnvikshaki comprises the Philosophy of Sankhya, Yoga, and\nLokayata (Atheism ?).\nRighteous and unrighteous acts (Dharmadharmau) are learnt\nfrom the triple Vedas; wealth and non-wealth from Varta; the\nexpedient and the inexpedient (Nayanayau), as well as potency and\nimpotency (Balabale) from the science of government.\nWhen seen in the light of these sciences, the science of\nAnvikshaki is most beneficial to the world, keeps the mind steady\nand firm in weal and woe alike, and bestows excellence of\nforesight, speech and action.\nLight to all kinds of knowledge, easy means to accomplish all\nkinds of acts and receptacle of all kinds of virtues, is the Science of\nAnvikshaki ever held to be.\n[Thus ends Chapter II, \"Determination of the place of Anvikshaki\"\namong Sciences in Book I, \"Concerning Discipline\" of the\n9",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nArthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya.]\nCHAPTER III. THE END OF SCIENCES.\nDetermination of the place of the Triple Vedas.\nTHE three Vedas, Sama, Rik and Yajus, constitute the triple\nVedas. These together with Atharvaveda and the Itihasaveda are\n(known as) the Vedas.\nSiksha (Phonetics), Kalpa (ceremonial injunctions),\nVyakarana (grammar), Nirukta (glossarial explanation of obscure\nVedic terms), Chandas (Prosody), and Astronomy form the Angas.\nAs the triple Vedas definitely determine the respective duties\nof the four castes and of the four orders of religious life, they are\nthe most useful.\nThe duty of the Brahman is study, teaching, performance of\nsacrifice, officiating in others' sacrificial performance and the\ngiving and receiving of gifts.\nThat of a Kshatriya is study, performance of sacrifice, giving\ngifts, military occupation, and protection of life.\nThat of a Vaisya is study, performance of sacrifice, giving\ngifts, agriculture, cattle breeding, and trade.\nThat of a Sudra is the serving of twice-born (dvijati),\nagriculture, cattle-breeding, and trade (varta), the profession of\nartizans and court-bards (karukusilavakarma).\n10",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nThe duty of a householder is earning livelihood by his own\nprofession, marriage among his equals of different ancestral Rishis,\nintercourse with his wedded wife after her monthly ablution, gifts\nto gods, ancestors, guests, and servants, and the eating of the\nremainder.\nThat of a student (Brahmacharin) is learning the Vedas,\nfire-worship, ablution, living by begging, and devotion to his\nteacher even at the cost of his own life, or in the absence of his\nteacher, to the teacher's son, or to an elder classmate.\nThat of a Vanaprastha (forest-recluse) is observance of\nchastity, sleeping on the bare ground, keeping twisted locks,\nwearing deer-skin, fire-worship, ablution, worship of gods,\nancestors, and guests, and living upon food stuffs procurable in\nforests.\nThat of an ascetic retired from the world (Parivrajaka) is\ncomplete control of the organs of sense, abstaining from all kinds\nof work, disowning money, keeping from society, begging in many\nplaces, dwelling in forests, and purity both internal and external.\nHarmlessness, truthfulness, purity, freedom from spite,\nabstinence from cruelty, and forgiveness are duties common to all.\nThe observance of one's own duty leads one to Svarga and\ninfinite bliss (Anantya). When it is violated, the world will come to\nan end owing to confusion of castes and duties.\nHence the king shall never allow people to swerve from their\nduties; for whoever upholds his own duty, ever adhering to the\ncustoms of the Aryas, and following the rules of caste and divisions\nof religious life, will surely. be happy both here and hereafter. For\nthe world, when maintained in accordance with injunctions of the\ntriple Vedas, will surely progress, but never perish.\n11",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\n[Thus ends Chapter III, \"Determination of the place of the Triple\nVedas\" among Sciences in Book I, \"Concerning Discipline\" of the\nArthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya.]\nCHAPTER IV. THE END OF SCIENCES.\nVarta and Dandaniti.\nAGRICULTURE, cattle-breeding and trade constitute Varta.\nIt is most useful in that it brings in grains, cattle, gold, forest\nproduce (kupya), and free labour (vishti). It is by means of the\ntreasury and the army obtained solely through Varta that the king\ncan hold under his control both his and his enemy's party.\nThat sceptre on which the well-being and progress of the\nsciences of Anvikshaki, the triple Vedas, and Varta depend is\nknown as Danda (punishment). That which treats of Danda is the\nlaw of punishment or science of government (dandaniti).\nIt is a means to make acquisitions, to keep them secure, to\nimprove them, and to distribute among the deserved the profits of.\nimprovement. It is on this science of government that the course of\nthe progress of the world depends.\n\"Hence,\" says my teacher, \"whoever is desirous of the\nprogress of the world shall ever hold the sceptre raised\n(udyatadanda). Never can there be a better instrument than the\nsceptre to bring people under control.\"\n\"No,\" says Kautilya; for whoever imposes severe punishment\nbecomes repulsive to the people; while he who awards mild\npunishment becomes contemptible. But whoever imposes\n12",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\npunishment as deserved becomes respectable. For punishment\n(danda) when awarded with due consideration, makes the people\ndevoted to righteousness and to works productive of wealth and\nenjoyment; while punishment, when ill-awarded under the\ninfluence of greed and anger or owing to ignorance, excites fury\neven among hermits and ascetics dwelling in forests, not to speak\nof householders.\nBut when the law of punishment is kept in abeyance, it gives\nrise to such disorder as is implied in the proverb of fishes\n(matsyanyayamudbhavayati); for in the absence of a magistrate\n(dandadharabhave), the strong will swallow the weak; but under\nhis protection, the weak resist the strong.\nThis people (loka) consisting of four castes and four orders of\nreligious life, when governed by the king with his sceptre, will\nkeep to their respective paths, ever devotedly adhering to their\nrespective duties and occupations.\n[Thus ends Chapter IV, \"Determination of the Place of Varta and of\nDandaniti\" among Sciences in Book I, \"Concerning Discipline\" of\nthe Arthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya. \"The End of Sciences\" is completed.]\nCHAPTER V. ASSOCIATION WITH THE AGED.\nHENCE the (first) three sciences (out of the four) are\ndependent for their well-being on the science of government.\nDanda, punishment, which alone can procure safety and security of\nlife is, in its turn, dependent on discipline (vinaya).\nDiscipline is of two kinds: artificial and natural; for\n13",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\ninstruction (kriya) can render only a docile being conformable to\nthe rules of discipline, and not an undocile being (adravyam). The\nstudy of sciences can tame only those who are possessed of such\nmental faculties as obedience, hearing, grasping, retentive\nmemory, discrimination, inference, and deliberation, but not others\ndevoid of such faculties.\nSciences shall be studied and their precepts strictly observed\nunder the authority of specialist teachers.\nHaving undergone the ceremony of tonsure, the student shall\nlearn the alphabet (lipi) and arithmetic. After investiture with\nsacred thread, he shall study the triple Vedas, the science of\nAnvikshaki under teachers of acknowledged authority (sishta), the\nscience of Vatra under government superintendents, and the\nscience of Dandaniti under theoretical and practical politicians\n(vaktriprayoktribhyah).\nHe (the prince) shall observe celibacy till he becomes sixteen\nyears old. Then he shall observe the ceremony of tonsure (godana)\nand marry.\nIn view of maintaining efficient discipline, he shall ever and\ninvariably keep company with aged professors of sciences in\nwhom alone discipline has its firm root.\nHe shall spend the forenoon in receiving lessons in military\narts concerning elephants, horses, chariots, and weapons, and the\nafternoon in hearing the Itihasa.\nPurana, Itivritta (history), Akhyayika (tales), Udaharana\n(illustrative stories), Dharmasastra, and Arthasastra are (known\nby the name) Itihasa.\n14",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nDuring the rest of the day and night, he shall not only receive\nnew lessons and revise old lessons, but also hear over and again\nwhat has not been clearly understood.\nFor from hearing (sutra) ensues knowledge; from knowledge\nsteady application (yoga) is possible; and from application\nself-possession (atmavatta) is possible. This is what is meant by\nefficiency of learning (vidhyasamarthyam).\nThe king who is well educated and disciplined in sciences,\ndevoted to good Government of his subjects, and bent on doing\ngood to all people will enjoy the earth unopposed.\n[Thus ends Chapter V, \"Association with the Aged\" in Book I,\n\"Concerning Discipline\" of the Arthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya.]\nCHAPTER VI. RESTRAINT OF THE ORGANS OF SENSE.\nThe Shaking off of the Aggregate of the Six Enemies.\nRESTRAINT of the organs of sense, on which success in\nstudy and discipline depends can be enforced by abandoning lust,\nanger, greed, vanity (m\u00e1na), haughtiness (mada), and overjoy\n(harsha).\nAbsence of discrepancy (avipratipatti) in the perception of\nsound, touch, colour, flavour, and scent by means of the ear, the\nskin, the eyes, the tongue, and the nose, is what is meant by the\nrestraint of the organs of sense. Strict observance of the precepts of\nsciences also means the same; for the sole aim of all the sciences is\nnothing but restraint of the organs of sense.\nWhosoever is of reverse character, whoever has not his\n15",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\norgans of sense under his control, will soon perish, though\npossessed of the whole earth bounded by the four quarters.\nFor example: Bhoja, known also by the name, D\u00e1ndakya,\nmaking a lascivious attempt on a Br\u00e1hman maiden, perished along\nwith his kingdom and relations;\nSo also Kar\u00e1la, the Vaideha. Likewise Janamejaya under the\ninfluence of anger against Br\u00e1hmans, as well as T\u00e1lajangha\nagainst the family of Bhrigus.\nAila in his attempt under the influence of greed to make\nexactions from Br\u00e1hmans, as well as Ajabindu, the Sauv\u00edra (in a\nsimilar attempt);\nR\u00e1vana unwilling under the influence of vanity to restore a\nstranger's wife, as well as Duryodhana to part with a portion of his\nkingdom; Dambhodbhava as well as Arjuna of Haihaya dynasty\nbeing so haughty as to despise all people;\nV\u00e1t\u00e1pi in his attempt under the influence of overjoy to attack\nAgastya, as well as the corporation of the Vrishnis in their attempt\nagainst Dvaip\u00e1yana.\nThus these and other several kings, falling a prey to the\naggregate of the six enemies and having failed to restrain their\norgans of sense, perished together with their kingdom and\nrelations. Having driven out the aggregate of the six enemies, as\nwell as Ambar\u00edsha of J\u00e1madagnya famous for his restraint of the\norgans of sense N\u00e1bh\u00e1ga long enjoyed the earth.\n[Thus ends Chapter VI, \"The Shaking off of the Aggregate of the\nSix Enemies\" in the section of the \"Restraint Of the Organs of\nSense\" in Book I, \"Concerning Discipline\" of the Arthas\u00e1stra of\nKautilya.]\n16",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nCHAPTER VII. RESTRAINT OF THE ORGANS OF SENSE.\nThe Life of a Saintly King.\nHENCE by overthrowing the aggregate of the six enemies, he\nshall restrain the organs of sense; acquire wisdom by keeping\ncompany with the aged; see through his spies; establish safety and\nsecurity by being ever active; maintain his subjects in the\nobservance of their respective duties by exercising authority; keep\nup his personal discipline by receiving lessons in the sciences; and\nendear himself to the people by bringing them in contact with\nwealth and doing good to them.\nThus with his organs of sense under his control, he shall keep\naway from hurting the women and property of others; avoid not\nonly lustfulness, even in dream, but also falsehood, haughtiness,\nand evil proclivities; and keep away from unrighteous and\nuneconomical transactions.\nNot violating righteousness and economy, he shall enjoy his\ndesires. He shall never be devoid of happiness. He may enjoy in an\nequal degree the three pursuits of life, charity, wealth, and desire,\nwhich are inter-dependent upon each other. Any one of these three,\nwhen enjoyed to an excess, hurts not only the other two, but also\nitself.\nKautilya holds that wealth and wealth alone is important,\ninasmuch as charity and desire depend upon wealth for their\nrealisation.\nThose teachers and ministers who keep him from falling a\nprey to dangers, and who, by striking the hours of the day as\ndetermined by measuring shadows (chh\u00e1y\u00e1n\u00e1lik\u00e1pratodena) warn\n17",

CREATION OF MINISTERS.\n\"THE King,\" says Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1ja, \"shall employ his classmates\nas his ministers; for they can be trusted by him inasmuch as he has\npersonal knowledge of their honesty and capacity.\"\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Vis\u00e1l\u00e1ksha, \"for, as they have been his playmates\nas well, they would despise him. But he shall employ as ministers\nthose whose secrets, possessed of in common, are well known to\nhim. Possessed of habits and defects in common. with the king,\nthey would never hurt him lest he would betray their secrets.\"\n\u201cCommon is this fear,\u201d says Par\u00e1sara, \u201cfor under the fear of\nbetrayal of his own secrets, the king may also follow them in their\ngood and bad acts.\n\"Under the control of as many persons as are made aware by\nthe king of his own secrets, might he place himself in all humility\nby that disclosure. Hence he shall employ as ministers those who\nhave proved faithful to him under difficulties fatal to life and are of\ntried devotion.\"\n18",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\n\"No,\u201d says Pisuna, \u201cfor this is devotion, but not intelligence\n(buddhigunah). He shall appoint as ministers those who, when\nemployed as financial matters, show as much as, or more than, the\nfixed revenue, and are thus of tried ability.\u201d\n\"No,\" says Kaunapadanta, \"for such persons are devoid of\nother ministerial qualifications; he shall, therefore, employ as\nministers those whose fathers and grandfathers had been ministers\nbefore; such persons, in virtue of their knowledge of past events\nand of an established relationship with the king, will, though\noffended, never desert him; for such faithfulness is seen even\namong dumb animals; cows, for example, stand aside from strange\ncows and ever keep company with accustomed herds.\"\n\"No,\" says V\u00e1tavy\u00e1dhi, \"for such persons, having acquired\ncomplete dominion over the king, begin to play themselves as the\nking. Hence he shall employ as ministers such new persons as are\nproficient in the science of polity. It is such new persons who will\nregard the king as the real sceptre-bearer (dandadhara) and dare\nnot offend him.\"\n\"No,\" says the son of B\u00e1hudant\u00ed (a woman); \"for a man\npossessed of only theoretical knowledge and having no experience\nof practical politics is likely to commit serious blunders when\nengaged in actual works. Hence he shall employ as ministers such\nas are born of high family and possessed of wisdom, purity of\npurpose, bravery and loyal feelings inasmuch as ministerial\nappointments shall purely depend on qualifications.\"\n\"This,\" says Kautilya, \"is satisfactory in all respects; for a\nman's ability is inferred from his capacity shown in work.

        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nMARRIAGE precedes the other calls of life (vyavah\u00e1ra.) The\ngiving in marriage of a maiden well-adorned is called\nBr\u00e1hma-marriage. The joint-performance of sacred duties (by a\nman and a woman) is known as pr\u00e1j\u00e1patya marriage.\n(The giving in marriage of a maiden) for a couple of cows is\ncalled Arsha. (The giving in marriage of a maiden) to an officiating\npriest in a sacrifice is called Daiva. The voluntary union of a\nmaiden with her lover is called G\u00e1ndharva. Giving a maiden after\nreceiving plenty of wealth (s\u00falka) is termed Asura. The abduction\nof a maiden is called R\u00e1kshasa. The abduction of a maiden while\nshe is asleep and in intoxication is called Pais\u00e1cha marraige.\nOf these, the first four are ancestral customs of old and are\nvalid on their being approved of by the father. The rest are to be\nsanctioned by both the father and the mother; for it is they that\nreceive the money (s\u00falka) paid by the bridegroom for their\ndaughter. In case of the absence by death of either the father or the\nmother, the survivor will receive the s\u00falka. If both of them are\ndead, the maiden herself shall receive it. Any kind of marriage is\napprovable, provided it pleases all those (that are concerned in it.)\n(Property of Women.)\nMeans of subsistence (vritti) or jewellery (\u00e1badhya)\nconstitutes what is called the property of a woman. Means of\nsubsistence valued at above two thousand shall be endowed (on her\nname). There is no limit to jewellery. It is no guilt for the wife to\nmake use of this property in maintaining her son, her\ndaughter-in-law or herself whenever her absent husband has made\nno provision for her maintenance. In calamities, disease and\nfamine, in warding off dangers and in charitable acts, the husband,\ntoo, may make use of this property.

Nor shall there\nbe any complaint if this property has been enjoyed for three years\nby those who are wedded in accordance with the customs of the\nfirst four kinds of marriage. But the enjoyment of this property in\nthe cases of G\u00e1ndharva and Asura marriages shall be liable to be\nrestored together with interest on it. In the case of such marriages\nas are called R\u00e1kshasa and Paisacha, the use of this property shall\nbe dealt with as theft. Thus the duty of marriage is dealt with.\nOn the death of her husband a woman, desirous to lead a pious\nlife, shall at once receive not only her endowment and jewellery\n(sth\u00e1py\u00e1bharanam), but also the balance of s\u00falka due to her. If\nboth of these two things are not actually in her possession, though\nnominally given to her, she shall at once receive both of them\ntogether with interest (on their value.) If she is desirous of a second\nmarriage (kutumbak\u00e1ma), she shall be given on the occasion of her\nremarriage (nivesak\u00e1le) whatever either her father-in-law or her\nhusband or both had given to her.

Whoever\njustly takes a woman under his protection shall equally protect her\nproperty. No woman shall succeed in her attempt to establish her\ntitle to the property of her husband.\nIf she lives a pious life, she may enjoy it (dharmak\u00e1m\u00e1\nbhunj\u00edta).

If a woman has many male children, then she shall\nconserve her own property in the same condition as she had\nreceived from her husband. Even that property which has been\ngiven her with full powers of enjoyment and disposal she shall\nendow in the name of her sons.\nA barren widow who is faithful to the bed of her dead\nhusband may, under the protection of her teacher, enjoy her\nproperty as long as she lives: for it is to ward off calamities that\nwomen are endowed with property. On her death, her property\nshall pass into the hands of her kinsmen (d\u00e1y\u00e1da).

It is no offence\nfor women to go to the houses of kinsmen under the circumstances\nof death, disease, calamities, and confinement of women. Whoever\nprevents her going under such circumstances, shall be fined 12\npanas. If a woman conceals herself under such circumstances, she\nshall forfeit her endowment. If her kinsmen conceal her (with a\nview to exempt her from giving her aid under such circumstances),\nthey shall lose the balance of sulka, money due to them from her\nhusband for giving her in marriage.

If on a road, or in\nthe middle of a forest, or in any other concealed places a woman\nfalls into the company of any other man, or if, with a view to\nenjoyment, she accompanies a suspicious or forbidden man, she\nshall be guilty of elopement (sangrahanam vidy\u00e1t). It is no offence\nfor women to fall into the company of actors, players, singers,\nfishermen, hunters, herdsmen, vintners, or persons of any other\nkind who usually travel with their women. If a man takes a woman\nwith him on his journey, though forbidden to do so, or if a woman\naccompanies a man though she is forbidden to do so, half of the\nabove fines shall be meted out to them. Thus elopement is dealt\nwith.\n(Re-marriage of women.)\nWives who belong to S\u00fadra, Vaisya, Kshatriya or Br\u00e1hman\ncaste, and who have not given birth to children should wait as long\nas a year for their husbands who have gone abroad for a short time;\nbut if they are such as have given birth to children, they should wait\nfor their absent husbands for more than a year.

If the husband is a\nBr\u00e1hman, studying abroad, his wife who has no issue should wait\nfor him for ten years; but if she has given birth to children, she\nshould wait for twelve years. If the husband is of Kshatriya caste,\nhis wife should wait for him till her death; but even if she bears\nchildren to a savarna husband, (i.e., a second husband belonging to\nthe same gotra as that of the former husband) with a view to avoid\nthe extinction of her race, she shall not be liable to contempt\n228",

In the case of a husband who is\ngone abroad but who is not heard of, his wife shall wait for the\nperiod of five menses, but if the absent husband is not heard of, his\nwife shall wait for him for the period of ten menses. In the case of a\nhusband who is gone abroad and is not heard of, his wife shall, if\nshe has received only a part of sulka from him, wait for him for the\nperiod of three menses; but if he is heard of, she shall wait for him\nfor the period of seven menses. A young wife who has received the\nwhole amount of sulka shall wait for the period of five menses for\nher absent husband who is not heard of; but if he is heard of, she\nshall wait for him for the period of ten menses. Then with the\npermission of judges (dharma-sthairvisrisht\u00e1), she may marry one\nwhom she likes; for neglect of intercourse with wife after her\nmonthly ablution is, in the opinion of Kautilya, a violation of one's\nduty (tirthoparodho hi dharmavadha iti Kautilyah).\nIn the case of husbands who have long gone abroad\n(dirgrhaprav\u00e1sinah), who have become ascetics, or who have been\ndead, their wives, having no issue, shall wait for them for the\nperiod of seven menses; but if they have given birth to children,\nthey shall wait for a year.

Kautilya says that it\nmust belong to both the living parents.\nThe son begotten by a man on his wife who has gone through\nall the required ceremonials is called aurasa, natural son; equal to\nhim is the son of an appointed daughter (putrik\u00e1putra); the son\nbegotten on a wife by another man, appointed for the purpose, and\nof the same gotra as that of the husband; or of a different gotra, is\ncalled kshetraja; on the death of the begetter, the kshetraja son will\nbe the son to both the fathers, follow the gotras of both, offer\nfuneral libations to both, and take possession of the immovable\nproperty (r\u00edktha) of both of them; of the same status as the\nkshetraja is he who is secretly begotten in the house of relatives\nand is called g\u00fadhaja, secretly born; the son cast off by his natural\nparents is called apaviddha and will belong to that man who\nperforms necessary religious ceremonials to him; the son born of a\nmaiden (before wedlock) is called k\u00e1n\u00edna; the son born of a woman\nmarried while carrying is called sahodha; the son of a remarried\nwoman (punarbh\u00e1t\u00e1y\u00e1h.) is called paunarbhava. A natural son can\nclaim relationship both with his father and his father's relatives; but\na son born to another man can have relationship only with his\nadopter. Of the same status as the latter is he who is given in\nadoption with water by both the father and mother and is called\ndatta. The son who, either of his own accord or following the\nintention of his relatives, offers himself to be the son of another, is\ncalled upagata. He who is appointed as a son is called kritaka; and\nhe who is purchased is called kr\u00edta.\n236",

The above kinds\nof sons are pratiloma, sons begotten by men of lower on women of\nhigher castes, and originate on account of kings violating all\ndharmas.\nThe son begotten by an Ugra on a Nish\u00e1da woman is called\nkukkuta and the same is called Pulkasa, if begotten in the inverse\norder. The son begotten by an Ambhashtha on a Vaidehaka woman\nis named Vaina; the same in the reverse order is called Kus\u00edlava.\nAn Ugra begets on a Kshatta woman as vap\u00e1ka.

Violation of this rule shall be punished\nwith a fine of 24 panas or 1/10th of the value of the merchandise\nsold against this rule.\nA person who attempts to return an article purchased by him\nshall if the article is other than what is naturally bad, or is\ndangerous, or is intolerable, be punished with a fine of 12 panas.\nThe same rescission rules that apply to a seller shall apply to the\npurchaser also.\n(Marriage Contracts)\n[As regards marriages among the three higher castes,\nrejection of a bride before the rite of p\u00e1nigrahana, clasping of\n268",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nhands, is valid; likewise among the S\u00fadras, observing religious\nrites. Even in the case of a couple that has gone through the rite of\np\u00e1nigrahana,] rejection of a bride whose guilt of having lain with\nanother man has been afterwards detected is valid. But never so in\nthe case of brides and bridegrooms of pure character and high\nfamily. Any person who has given a girl in marriage without\nannouncing her guilt of having lain with another shall not only be\npunished with a fine of 96 panas, but also be made to return the\nsulka and str\u00eddhana. Any person receiving a girl in marriage\nwithout announcing the blemishes of the bridegroom shall not only\npay double the above fine, but also forfeit the sulka and str\u00eddhana\n(he paid for the bride).\n(Sale of bipeds, etc.)\nSale of bipeds and quadrupeds as strong, healthy, and clean\nthough they are either unclean or actually suffering from leprosy\nand other diseases, shall be punished with a fine of 12 panas. The\ntime of rescission of sale is three fortnights for quadrupeds and one\nyear for men; for it is possible to know by that time their good or\nbad condition.\n* An assembly convened for the purpose shall, in the matter\nof rescending sales or gifts, decide in such a way that neither the\ngiver nor the receiver shall be injured thereby.\n[Thus ends Chapter XV, \u201cRescission of purchase and sale\u201d in Book\nIII, \u201cConcerning Law\u201d of the Arthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya.

        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nWITHOUT OWNERSHIP AND OWNERSHIP.\nRULES concerning recovery of debts shall also apply to\nresumption of gifts. Invalid gifts shall be kept in the safe custody of\nsome persons. Any person who has given as gift not only his whole\nproperty, his sons, and his wife, but also his own life shall bring the\nsame for the consideration of rescissors. Gifts or charitable\nsubscriptions to the wicked or for unworthy purposes, monetary\nhelp to such persons as are malevolent or cruel, and promise of\nsexual enjoyment to the unworthy shall be so settled by rescissors\nthat neither the giver nor the receiver shall be injured thereby.\nThose who receive any kind of aid from timid persons,\nthreatening them with legal punishment, defamation, or loss of\nmoney, shall be liable to the punishment for theft; and the persons\nwho yield such aids shall likewise be punished.\nCo-operation in hurting a person, and showing a haughty\nattitude towards the king shall be punished with the highest\namercement. No son, or heir claiming a dead man\u201fs property shall,\nagainst his own will, pay the value of the bail borne by the dead\nman (pr\u00e1tibh\u00e1vyadanda), the balance of any dowry (sulkasesha),\nor the stakes of gambling; nor shall he fulfill the promise of gifts\nmade by the dead man under the influence of liquor or love. Thus\nresumption of gifts is dealt with.\n(Sale without ownership.)\nAs regards sale without ownership:--On the detection of a lost\nproperty in the possession of another person, the owner shall cause\nthe offender to be arrested through the judges of a court. If time or\nplace does not permit this action, the owner himself shall catch\nhold of the offender and bring him before the judges. The judge\nshall put the question; how the offender came by the property. If he\n270",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nnarrates how he got it, but cannot produce the person who sold it to\nhim, he shall be left off, and shall forfeit the property. But the\nseller, if produced, shall not only pay the value of the property, but\nalso be liable to the punishment for theft.\nIf a person with a stolen property in his possession runs away\nor hides himself till the property is wholly consumed, he shall not\nonly pay the value, but also be liable to the punishment for theft.\nAfter proving his claim to a lost property (svakaranam\nkritva), its owner shall be entitled to take possession of it. On his\nfailure to prove his title to it, he shall be fined 5 times the value of\nthe property, (panchabandhadandah), and the property shall be\ntaken by the king.\nIf the owner takes possession of a lost article without\nobtaining permission from the court, he shall be punished with the\nfirst amercement.\nStolen or lost articles shall, on being detected, be kept in the\ntoll-gate. If no claimant is forthcoming within three fortnights,\nsuch articles shall be taken by the king.\nHe who proved his title to a lost or stolen biped shall pay 5\npanas towards ransom (before taking possession of it). Likewise\nthe ransom for a single-hoofed animal shall be 4 panas; for a cow\nor a buffalo, 2 panas, for minor quadrupeds \u00bcth of a pana; and for\narticles such as precious stones, superior or inferior raw materials,\nfive per cent of their value.\nWhatever of the property of his own subjects the king brings\nback from the forests and countries of enemies, shall be handed\nover to its owner. Whatever of the property of citizens robbed by\nthieves the king cannot recover, shall be made good from his own\n271",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\npocket. If the king is unable to recover such things, he shall either\nallow any self-elected person (svayamgr\u00e1ha) to fetch them, or pay\nan equivalent ransom to the sufferer. An adventurer may enjoy\nwhatever the king graciously gives him out of the booty he has\nplundered from an enemy's country, excepting the life of an Arya\nand the property belonging to gods, Br\u00e1hmans or ascetics. Thus\nsale without ownership is dealt with.\n(Ownership.)\nAs to the title of an owner to his property :--The owners who\nhave quitted their country where their property lies shall continue\nto have their title to it. When the owners other than minors, the\naged, those that are afflicted with decease or calamities, those that\nare sojourning abroad, or those that have deserted their country\nduring national disturbances, neglect for ten years their property\nwhich is under the enjoyment of others, they shall forfeit their title\nto it.\nBuildings left for 20 years in the enjoyment of others shall not\nbe reclaimed. But the mere occupation of the buildings of others\nduring the absence of the king by kinsmen, priests, or heretics shall\nnot give them the right of possession. The same shall obtain with\nregard to open deposits, pledges, treasure trove (nidhi), boundary,\nor any property belonging to kings or priests (srotriyas).\nAscetics and heretics shall, without disturbing each other,\nreside in a large area. A new comer shall, however, be provided\nwith the space occupied by an old resident. If not willing to do so,\nthe old occupier shall be sent out.\nThe property of hermits, (v\u00e1naprastha) ascetics (yati), or\nbachelors learning the Vedas (Brahmach\u00e1ri) shall on their death be\ntaken by their preceptors, disciples, their brethren\n(dharmabhr\u00e1tri), or class-mates in succession.\n272",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nWhenever hermits, etc., have to pay any fines, they may, in\nthe name of the king, perform penance, oblation to gods,\nfireworship, or the ritual called Mah\u00e1kachchhavardhana for as\nmany nights as the number of panas of their fines. Those heretics\n(p\u00e1shand\u00e1h) who have neither gold nor gold-coin shall similarly\nobserve their fasts except in the case of defamation, theft, assault\nand abduction of women. Under these circumstances, they shall be\ncompelled to undergo punishment.\n* The king shall, under penalty of fines, forbid the wilful or\nimproper proceedings of ascetics: for vice overwhelming\nrighteousness will in the long run destroy the ruler himself.\n[Thus ends Chapter XVI, \"Resumption of gifts, sale without\nownership, and ownership\" in Book III, \"Concerning Law\" of the\nArthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya. End of the seventy-third chapter from the\nbeginning.]\nCHAPTER XVII. ROBBERY.\nSUDDEN and direct seizure (of person or property) is termed\ns\u00e1hasa; fraudulent or indirect seizure (niranvaye\u2019pavyayanecha) is\ntheft.\nThe school of Manu hold that the fine for the direct seizure of\nprecious stones and superior or inferior raw materials shall be\nequal to their value. It is equal to twice the value of the articles\naccording to the followers of Usanas.\nBut Kautilya holds that it shall be proportional to the gravity\nof the crime.\n273",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nIn the case of such articles of small value as flowers, fruits,\nvegetables, roots, turnips, cooked rice, skins, bamboo, and pots\n(earthenware) the fine shall range from 12 to 24 papas; for articles\nof great value such as iron (k\u00e1l\u00e1yasa), wood, roping materials, and\nherds of minor quadrupeds, the fine shall range from 24 to 48\npanas; and for such articles of still greater value as copper, brass,\nbronze, glass, ivory and vessels, etc., it shall range from 48 to 96\npanas. This fine is termed the first amercement.\nFor the seizure of such as big quadrupeds, men, fields,\nhouses, gold, gold-coins, fine fabrics, etc., the fine shall range from\n200 to 500 panas, which is termed the middle-most amercement.\nMy preceptor holds that keeping or causing to keep by force\neither men or women in prison, or releasing them by force from\nimprisonment, shall be punished with fines ranging from 500 to\n1,000 panas. This fine is termed the highest amercement.\nHe who causes another to commit s\u00e1hasa after the plans\nprepared by himself shall be fined twice the value (of the person or\nproperty seized). An abettor who employs a hireling to comit\ns\u00e1hasa by promising \u201eI shall pay thee as much gold as thou makest\nuse of,\u201f shall be fined four times the value.\nThe school of Brihaspati are of opinion that if with the\npromise \u201eI will pay thee this amount of gold,\u201f an abettor causes\nanother to commit s\u00e1hasa, the former shall be compelled to pay the\npromised amount of gold and a fine. But Kautilya holds that if an\nabettor extenuates his crime by pleading anger, intoxication or loss\nof sense (moham), he shall be punished as described above.\n* In all kinds of fines below a hundred panas, the king shall\ntake in addition to the fine 8 per cent more as r\u00fapa and in fines\nabove hundred, five per cent more; these two kinds of exaction, are\n274",

DEFAMATION.\nCALUMNY, contemptuous talk, or intimidation constitutes\ndefamation.\nAmong abusive expressions relating to the body, habits,\nlearning, occupation, or nationalities, that of calling a deformed\nman by his right name such as \u201ethe blind\u201f, \u201ethe lame\u201f, etc. shall be\npunished with a fine of 3 panas; and by false name 6 panas. If the\nblind, the lame, etc., are insulted with such ironical expressions as\n\u201ea man of beautiful eyes\u201f, \u201ea man of beautiful teeth\u201f, etc. the fine\nshall be 12 panas. Likewise when a person is taunted for leprosy,\nlunacy, impotency and the like. Abusive expressions in general, no\nmatter whether true, false, or reverse with reference to the abused,\nshall be punished with fines ranging above 12 panas, in the case of\npersons of equal rank.\nIf persons abused happen to be of superior rank, the amount\nof the fines shall be doubled; if of lower rank, it shall be halved.\nFor calumniating the wives of others, the amount of the fines shall\nbe doubled.\nIf abuse is due to carelessness, intoxication, or loss of sense,\netc., the fines shall be halved.\nAs to the reality of leprosy and lunacy, physicians or\n275",

If any one of\na higher caste abuses one of a lower caste, fines imposed shall\ndecrease from 2 panas.\nContemptuous expressions such as 'a bad Br\u00e1hman' shall\nalso be punished as above.\nThe same rules shall apply to calumnies regarding learning\n(sruta), the profession of buffoons (v\u00e1gj\u00edvana), artisans, or\nmusicians, and relating to nationalities such as Pr\u00e1jjunaka,\nG\u00e1ndh\u00e1ra, etc.\n(Intimidation.)\nIf a person intimidates another by using such expressions as \u201eI\nshall render thee thus\u201f, the bravado shall be punished with half as\nmuch fine as will be levied on him who actually does so.\nIf a person, being unable to carry his threat into effect, pleads\nprovocation, intoxication, or loss of sense as his excuse, he shall be\nfined 12 panas.\nIf a person capable to do harm and under the influence of\n276",

Substitution\nby tricks of hand of dice other than thus supplied shall be punished\nwith a fine of 12 panas.

This can be\nforeseen; but misfortune due to providence cannot be known.\nThe king who, being possessed of good character and\nbest-fitted elements of sovereignty, is the fountain of policy, is\ntermed the conqueror.\nThe king who is situated anywhere immediately on the\ncircumference of the conqueror's territory is termed the enemy.\nThe king who is likewise situated close to the enemy, but\nseparated from the conqueror only by the enemy, is termed the\nfriend (of the conqueror).\nA neighbouring foe of considerable power is styled an\nenemy; and when he is involved in calamities or has taken himself\nto evil ways, he becomes assailable; and when he has little or no\nhelp, he becomes destructible; otherwise (i.e., when he is provided\nwith some help), he deserves to be harassed or reduced.

As each of these three\nkings possesses the five elements of sovereignty, such as the\nminister, the country, the fort, the treasury, and the army, a circle of\nstates consists of eighteen elements. Thus, it needs no commentary\nto understand that the (three) Circles of States having the enemy\n(of the conqueror), the Madhyama king, or the neutral king at the\ncentre of each of the three circles, are different from that of the\nconqueror.

Strength is power, and happiness is\nthe end.\nStrength is of three kinds: power of deliberation is intellectual\nstrength; the possession of a prosperous treasury and a strong army\nis the strength of sovereignty; and martial power is physical\nstrength.\nThe end is also of three kinds: that which is attainable by\ndeliberation is the end of deliberation; that which is attainable by\nthe strength of sovereignty is the end of sovereignty; and that\nwhich is to be secured by perseverance is the end of martial power.\nThe possession of power and happiness in a greater degree\nmakes a king superior to another; in a less degree, inferior; and in\nan equal degree, equal. Hence a king shall always endeavor to\naugment his own power and elevate his happiness.\nA king who is equal to his enemy in the matter of his\nsovereign elements shall, in virtue of his own righteous conduct or\nwith the help of those who are hostile or conspiring against his\nenemy, endeavor to throw his enemy\u201fs power into the shade; or if\nhe thinks:--\n\"That my enemy, possessed as he is of immense power, will\nyet in the near future, hurt the elements of his own sovereignty, by\nusing contumelious language, by inflicting severe punishments,\nand by squandering his wealth; that though attaining success for a\ntime yet he will blindly take himself to hunting, gambling, drinking\nand women; that as his subjects are disaffected, himself powerless\n368",

Then he may begin to set one of them against the other\nby telling each that the other is a tyrant causing utter ruin to\nhimself, and thus cause dissension between them.

CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT MARCHING\nAGAINST AN ASSAILABLE ENEMY AND A STRONG\nENEMY; CAUSES LEADING TO THE DWINDLING,\nGREED, AND DISLOYALTY OF THE ARMY; AND\nCONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE COMBINATION OF\nPOWERS.\nWHEN two enemies, one an assailable enemy and another a\nstrong enemy, are equally involved in troubles, which of them is to\nbe marched against first?\nThe strong enemy is to be marched against first; after\nvanquishing him, the assailable enemy is to be attacked, for, when\n384",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\na strong enemy has been vanquished, an assailable enemy will\nvolunteer of his own accord to help the conqueror; but not so, a\nstrong enemy.\nWhich is to be marched against---an assailable enemy\ninvolved in troubles to a greater degree or a strong enemy troubled\nto a lesser degree?\nMy teacher says that as a matter of easy conquest, the\nassailable enemy under worse troubles should be marched against\nfirst.\nNot so, says Kautilya: The conqueror should march against\nthe strong enemy under less troubles, for the troubles of the strong\nenemy, though less, will be augmented when attacked. True, that\nthe worse troubles of the assailable enemy will be still worse when\nattacked. But when left to himself, the strong enemy under less\ntroubles will endeavour to get rid of his troubles and unite with the\nassailable enemy or with another enemy in the rear of the\nconqueror.\nWhen there are two assailable enemies, one of virtuous\ncharacter and under worse troubles, and another of vicious\ncharacter, under less troubles, and with disloyal subjects, which of\nthem is to be marched against first?\nWhen the enemy of virtuous character and under worse\ntroubles is attacked, his subjects will help him; whereas, the\nsubjects of the other of vicious character and under less troubles\nwill be indifferent. Disloyal or indifferent subjects will endeavour\nto destroy even a strong king. Hence the conqueror should march\nagainst that enemy whose subjects are disloyal.\nWhich is to be marched against--an enemy whose subjects are\n385",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nimpoverished and greedy or an enemy whose subjects are being\noppressed?\nMy teacher says that the conqueror should march against that\nenemy whose subjects are impoverished and greedy, for\nimpoverished and greedy subjects suffer themselves to be won\nover to the other side by intrigue, and are easily excited. But not so\nthe oppressed subjects whose wrath can be pacified by punishing\nthe chief men (of the State).\nNot so, says Kautilya: for though impoverished and greedy,\nthey are loyal to their master and are ready to stand for his cause\nand to defeat any intrigue against him; for it is in loyalty that all\nother good qualities have their strength. Hence the conqueror\nshould march against the enemy whose subjects are oppressed.\nWhich enemy is to be marched against--a powerful enemy of\nwicked character or a powerless enemy of righteous character?\nThe strong enemy of wicked character should be marched\nagainst, for when he is attacked, his subjects will not help him, but\nrather put him down or go to the side of the conqueror. But when\nthe enemy of virtuous character is attacked, his subjects will help\nhim or die with him.\n* By insulting the good and commending the wicked; by causing\nunnatural and unrighteous slaughter of life;\n* by neglecting the observance of proper and righteous customs; by\ndoing unrighteous acts and neglecting righteous ones;\n* by doing what ought not to be done and not doing what ought to\nbe done; by not paying what ought to be paid and exacting what\nought not to be taken;\n* by not punishing the guilty and severely punishing the less guilty;\nby arresting those who are not to be caught hold of and leaving\n386",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nthose who are to be arrested;\n* by undertaking risky works and destroying profitable ones; by\nnot protecting the people against thieves and by robbing them of\ntheir wealth;\n* by giving up manly enterprise and condemning good works; by\nhurting the leaders of the people and despising the worthy;\n* by provoking the aged, by crooked conduct, and by\nuntruthfulness; by not applying remedies against evils and\nneglecting works in hand;\n* and by carelessness and negligence of himself in maintaining the\nsecurity of person and property of his subjects, the king causes\nimpoverishment, greed, and disaffection to appear among his\nsubjects;\n* when a people are impoverished, they become greedy; when they\nare greedy, they become disaffected; when disaffected, they\nvoluntarily go to the side of the enemy or destroy their own master.\nHence, no king should give room to such causes as would\nbring about impoverishment, greed or disaffection among his\npeople. If, however, they appear, he should at once take remedial\nmeasures against them.\nWhich (of the three) is the worst--an impoverished people?\ngreedy people? or disaffected people?\nAn impoverished people are ever apprehensive of oppression\nand destruction (by over-taxation, etc.), and are therefore desirous\nof getting rid of their impoverishment, or of waging war or of\nmigrating elsewhere.\nA greedy people are ever discontented and they yield\nthemselves to the intrigues of an enemy.\nA disaffected people rise against their master along with his\n387",

The dearth of\nefficient men can be made up by means of gold and grain. Greed\n(is) partial and is found among a few chief officers, and it can be\ngot rid of or satisfied by allowing them to plunder an enemy's\nwealth. Disaffection or disloyalty (vir\u00e1ga) can be got rid of by\nputting down the leaders; for in the absence of a leader or leaders,\nthe people are easily governed (bhogya) and they will not take part\nin the intrigues of enemies. When a people are too nervous to\nendure the calamities, they first become dispersed, when their\nleaders are put down; and when they are kept under restraint, they\nendure calamities.\nHaving well considered the causes which bring about peace\nor war, one should combine with kings of considerable power and\nrighteous character and march against one's enemy.\n\u201eA king of considerable power,\u201f means one who is strong\nenough to put down or capture an enemy in the rear of his friend or\nto give sufficient help to his friend in his march.\n\u201eA king of righteous character,\u201f means one who does what\none has promised to do, irrespective of good or bad results.\nHaving combined with one of superior power, or with two of\nequal power among such kings, should the conqueror march\nagainst his enemy?\nIt is better to march combined with two kings of equal power;\nfor, if combined with a king of superior power, the ally appears to\nmove, caught hold of, by his superior, whereas in marching with\ntwo kings of equal power, the same will be the result, only, when\n388",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nthose two kings are experts in the art of intrigue; besides it is easy\nto separate them; and when one of them is wicked, he can be put\ndown by the other two and made to suffer the consequence of\ndissension.\nCombined with one of equal power or with two of lesser\npower, should a king march against his enemy?\nBetter to march with two kings of lesser power; for the\nconqueror can depute them to carry out any two different works\nand keep them under his control. When the desired end is achieved,\nthe inferior king will quietly retire after the satisfaction of his\nsuperior.\n* Till his discharge, the good conduct of an ally of usually bad\ncharacter should be closely scrutinised either by suddenly coming\nout at a critical time from a covert position (sattra) to examine his\nconduct, or by having his wife as a pledge for his good conduct.\n* Though actuated with feelings of true friendship, the conqueror\nhas reason to fear his ally, though of equal power, when the latter\nattains success in his mission; having succeeded in his mission, an\nally of equal power is likely to change his attitude even towards the\nconqueror of superior power.\n* An ally of superior power should not be relied upon, for\nprosperity changes the mind. Even with little or no share in the\nspoils, an ally of superior power may go back, appearing\ncontented; but some time afterwards, he may not fail to sit on the\nlap of the conqueror and carry off twice the amount of share due to\nhim.\n* Having been satisfied with mere victory, the leading conqueror\nshould discharge his allies, having satisfied them with their shares\nhe may allow himself to be conquered by them instead of\nattempting to conquer them (in the matter of spoils); it is thus that a\nking can win the good graces of his Circle of States.\n389",

Still, that kind of land\ncontaining mines and which yields precious metals to purchase\nlarge tracts of land is far better.\nMy teacher says that of the two forests, one productive of\ntimber, and another of elephants, the former is the source of all\nkinds of works and is of immense help in forming a store-house,\nwhile the latter is of reverse character.\nNot so, says Kautilya, for it is possible to plant any of\ntimber-forests in many places, but not an elephant-forest; yet it is\non elephants that the destruction of an enemy's army depends.\nOf the two, communication by water and by land, the former\nis not long-standing, while the latter can ever be enjoyed.\nWhich is better, the land with scattered people or that with a\ncorporation of people?\nThe former is better inasmuch as it can be kept under control\nand is not susceptible to the intrigues of enemys while the latter is\n413",

What can a depopulated country like a\nbarren cow be productive of?\nThe king who is desirous of getting back the land sold for\ncolonization to another when the latter has lost his men and money\nin colonizing it, should first make an agreement with such a\npurchaser as is weak, base-born, devoid of energy, helpless, of\nunrighteous character, addicted to evil ways, trusting to fate, and\nindiscreet in his actions. When the colonization of a land entails\nmuch expenditure of men and money, and when a weak and\nbase-born man attempts to colonize it, he will perish along with his\npeople in consequence of his loss of men and money. Though\nstrong, a base-born man will be deserted by his people who do not\nlike him lest they may come to grief under him; though possessing\nan army, he cannot employ it if he is devoid of energy; and such an\narmy will perish in consequence of the loss incurred by its master;\nthough possessing wealth, a man who hesitates to part with his\n414",

It is also possible to infuse spirit\nand enthusiasm in the timid by means of discipline and training.\nOf mines, whoever exploits with less labour and expenditure\na mine of valuable output and of easy communication overreaches\nthe other.\nWhich is better of the two, a small mine of valuable yield, or a\nbig mine productive of commodities of inferior value?\n417",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nMy teacher says that the former is better inasmuch as valuable\nproducts, such as diamonds, precious stones, pearls, corals, gold\nand silver, can swallow vast quantities of inferior commodities.\nNot so, says Kautilya, for there is the possibility of\npurchasing valuable commodities by a mass of accumulated\narticles of inferior value, collected from a vast and longstanding\nmine of inferior commodities.\nThis explains the selection of trade-routes:\nMy teacher says that of the two trade-routes, one by water and\nanother by land, the former is better, inasmuch as it is less\nexpensive, but productive of large profit.\nNot so, says Kautilya, for water route is liable to obstruction,\nnot permanent, a source of imminent dangers, and incapable of\ndefence, whereas a land-route is of reverse nature.\nOf water-routes, one along the shore and another in\nmid-ocean, the route along, and close to the shore is better, as it\ntouches at many trading port-towns; likewise river navigation is\nbetter, as it is uninterrupted and is of avoidable or endurable\ndangers.\nMy teacher says that of land-routes, that which leads to the\nHimalayas is better than that which leads to the south.\nNot so, says Kautilya, for with the exception of blankets,\nskins, and horses, other articles of merchandise such as,\nconch-shells, diamonds, precious stones, pearls and gold are\navailable in plenty in the south.\nOf routes leading to the south, either that trade-route which\n418",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\ntraverses a large number of mines which is frequented by people,\nand which is less expensive or troublesome, or that route by taking\nwhich plenty of merchandise of various kinds can be obtained is\nbetter.\nThis explains the selection of trade-routes leading either to\nthe east or to the west.\nOf a cart-track and a foot-path, a cart-track is better as it\naffords facilities for preparations on a large scale.\nRoutes that can be traversed by asses or camels, irrespective\nof countries and seasons are also good.\nThis explains the selection of trade-routes traversed by men\nalone (amsa-patha, shoulder-path, i.e., a path traversed by men\ncarrying merchandise on their shoulders).\n* It is a loss for the conqueror to undertake that kind of work which\nis productive of benefits to the enemy, while a work of reverse\nnature is a gain. When the benefits are equal, the conqueror has to\nconsider that his condition is stagnant.\n* Likewise it is a loss to undertake a work of less out-put and of a\ngreater outlay, while a work of reverse nature is a gain. If the\nout-put and outlay of a work are at par, the conqueror has to\nconsider that his condition is stagnant.\n* Hence the conqueror should find out such fort-building and other\nworks as, instead of being expensive, are productive of greater\nprofit and power. Such is the nature of agreements for undertaking\nworks.\n[Thus ends Chapter XII, \"Agreement for Undertaking a Work,\" in\nthe section of \"Agreement for the Acquisition of a Friend, Gold, or\nLand and Agreement for Undertaking a Work\"' in Book VIII, \"The\nEnd of the Six-fold Policy\u201d of the Arthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya.

CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT AN ENEMY\nIN THE REAR.\nWHEN the conqueror and his enemy simultaneously\nproceeded to capture the rear of their respective enemies who are\nengaged in an attack against others, he who captures the rear of one\nwho is possessed of vast resources gains more advantages\n(atisandhatte); for one who is possessed of vast resources has to\nput down the rear-enemy only after doing away with one's frontal\nenemy already attacked, but not one who is poor in resources and\nwho has not realised the desired profits.\nResources being equal, he who captures the rear of one who\nhas made vast preparations gains more advantages for one who has\nmade vast preparations has to put down the enemy in the rear only\nafter destroying the frontal enemy, but not one whose preparations\nare made on a small scale and whose movements are, therefore,\nobstructed by the Circle of States.\nPreparations being equal, he who captures the rear of one who\nhas marched out with all the resources gains more advantages; for\none whose base is undefended is easy to be subdued, but not one\nwho has marched out with a part of the army after having made\narrangements to defend the rear.\nTroops taken being of equal strength, he who captures the rear\nof one who has gone against a wandering enemy gains more\nadvantages; for one who has marched out against a wandering\nenemy has to put down the rear-enemy only after obtaining an easy\n420",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nvictory over the wandering enemy; but not one who has marched\nout against an entrenched enemy, for one who has marched out\nagainst an entrenched enemy will be repelled in his attack against\nthe enemy's forts and will, after his return, find himself between the\nrear-enemy, and the frontal enemy who is possessed of strong forts.\nThis explains the cases of other enemies described before.\nEnemies being of equal description, he who attacks the rear of\none who has gone against a virtuous king gains more advantages,\nfor one who has gone against a virtuous king will incur the\ndispleasure of even his own people, whereas one who has attacked\na wicked king will endear himself to all.\nThis explains the consequences of capturing the rear of those\nwho have marched against an extravagant king or a king living\nfrom hand to mouth, or a niggardly king.\nThe same reasons hold good in the case of those who have\nmarched against their own friends.\nWhen there are two enemies, one engaged in attacking a\nfriend and another an enemy, he who attacks the rear of the latter\ngains more advantages: for one who has attacked a friend will, after\neasily making peace with the friend, proceed against the\nrear-enemy; for it is easier to make peace with a friend than with an\nenemy.\nWhen there are two kings, one engaged in destroying a friend,\nand another an enemy, he who attacks the rear of the former gains\nmore advantages; for one who is engaged in destroying an enemy\nwill have the support of his friends and will thereby put down the\nrear-enemy, but not the former who is engaged in destroying his\nown side.\n421",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nWhen the conqueror and his enemy in their attack against the\nrear of an enemy mean to enforce the payment of what is not due to\nthem, he whose enemy has lost considerable profits and has\nsustained a great loss of men and money gains more advantages;\nwhen they mean to enforce the payment of what is due to them,\nthen he whose enemy has lost profits and army, gains more\nadvantages.\nWhen the assailable enemy is capable of retaliation and when\nthe assailant's rear-enemy, capable of augmenting his army and\nother resources, has entrenched himself on one of the assailant's\nflanks, then the rear-enemy gains more advantages; for a rear\nenemy on one of the assailant's flanks will not only become a\nfriend of the assailable enemy, but also attack the base of the\nassailant, whereas a rear-enemy behind the assailant can only\nharass the rear.\n* Kings, capable of harassing the rear of an enemy and of\nobstructing his movements are three: the group of kings situated\nbehind the enemy, and the group of kings on his flanks.\n* He who is situated between a conqueror and his enemy is called\nan antardhi (one between two kings); when such a king is\npossessed of forts, wild tribes, and other kinds of help, he proves an\nimpediment in the way of the strong.\nWhen the conqueror and his enemy are desirous of catching\nhold of a madhyama king and attack the latter's rear, then he who in\nhis attempt to enforce the promised payment separates the\nmadhyama king from the latter's friend and obtains, thereby, an\nenemy as a friend, gains more advantages; for an enemy compelled\nto sue for peace will be of greater help than a friend compelled to\nmaintain the abandoned friendship.\nThis explains the attempt to catch hold of a neutral king.\n422",

Then\nthe recipients of salaries from two states, exhibiting the acquisition\nof large profits (to the leader), may satirise the kings, saying, \"You\nare all very well combined.\"\nIf some of the kings of the combination are wicked, they may\nbe made to break the treaty; then the recipients of salaries from two\nstates may again tell them so as to break the combination entirely:\n\"This is just what we have already pointed out.\"\nWhen the enemies are separated, the conqueror may move\nforward by catching hold of any of the kings (as an ally).\nIn the absence of a leader, the conqueror may win him over\nwho is the inciter of the combination; or who is of a resolute mind,\nor who has endeared himself to his people, or who, from greed or\nfear, joined the combination, or who is afraid of the conqueror, or\nwhose friendship with the conqueror is based upon some\nconsanguinity of royalty, or who is a friend, or who is a wandering\nenemy,--in the order of enumeration.\nOf these, one has to please the inciter by surrendering oneself;\nby conciliation and salutation; him who is of a resolute mind; by\ngiving a daughter in marriage or by availing oneself of his youth (to\nbeget a son on one's wife?); him who is the beloved of his people,\nby giving twice the amount of profits; him who is greedy, by\nhelping with men and money; him who is afraid of the\n425",

        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nshould be whether it is easier to take an offensive or defensive\nattitude. National calamities, coming from Providence or from man\nhappen from one's misfortune or bad policy. The word vyasana\n(vices or calamities), means the reverse or absence of virtue, the\npreponderance of vices, and occasional troubles. That which\ndeprives (vyasyati) a person of his happiness is termed vyasana\n(vices or calamities).\nMy teacher says that of the calamities, viz., the king in\ndistress, the minister in distress, the people in distress, distress due\nto bad fortifications, financial distress, the army in distress, and an\nally in distress,--that which is first mentioned is more serious than\nthe one, coming later in the order of enumeration.\nNo, says Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1ja, of the distress of the king and of his\nminister, ministerial distress is more serious; deliberations in\ncouncil, the attainment of results as anticipated while deliberating\nin council, the accomplishment of works, the business of\nrevenue-collection and its expenditure, recruiting the army, the\ndriving out of the enemy and of wild tribes, the protection of the\nkingdom, taking remedial measures against calamities, the\nprotection of the heir-apparent, and the installation of princes\nconstitute the duties of ministers. In the absence of ministers; the\nabove works are ill-done; and like a bird, deprived of its feathers,\nthe king loses his active capacity. In such calamities, the intrigues\nof the enemy find a ready scope. In ministerial distress, the king's\nlife itself comes into danger, for a minister is the mainstay of the\nsecurity of the king's life.\nNo, says Kautilya, it is verily the king who attends to the\nbusiness of appointing ministers, priests, and other servants,\nincluding the superintendents of several departments, the\napplication of remedies against the troubles of his people, and of\nhis kingdom, and the adoption of progressive measures; when his\n445",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nministers fall into troubles, he employs others; he is ever ready to\nbestow rewards on the worthy and inflict punishments on the\nwicked; when the king is well off, by his welfare and prosperity, he\npleases the people; of what kind the king's character is, of the same\nkind will be the character of his people; for their progress or\ndownfall, the people depend upon the king; the king is, as it were,\nthe aggregate of the people.\nVis\u00e1l\u00e1ksha says that of the troubles of the minister and of the\npeople; the troubles of the people are more serious; finance, army,\nraw products, free labour, carriage of things, and collection (of\nnecessaries) are all secured from the people. There will be no such\nthings in the absence of people, next to the king and his minister.\nNo, says Kautilya, all activities proceed from the minister,\nactivities such as the successful accomplishment of the works of\nthe people, security of person and property from internal and\nexternal enemies, remedial measures against calamities,\ncolonization and improvement of wild tracts of land, recruiting the\narmy, collection of revenue, and bestowal of favour.\nThe school of Par\u00e1sara say that of the distress of the people\nand distress due to bad fortifications, the latter is a more serious\nevil; for it is in fortified towns that the treasury and the army are\nsecured; they (fortified towns) are a secure place for the people;\nthey are a stronger power than the citizens or country people; and\nthey are a powerful defensive instrument in times of danger for the\nking. As to the people, they are common both to the king and his\nenemy.\nNo, says Kautilya, for forts, finance, and the army depend\nupon the people; likewise buildings, trade, agricu1ture,\ncattle-rearing, bravery, stability, power, and abundance (of things).\nIn countries inhabited by people, there are mountains and islands\n446",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\n(as natural forts); in the absence of an expansive country, forts are\nresorted to. When a country consists purely of cultivators, troubles\ndue to the absence of fortifications (are apparent); while in a\ncountry which consists purely of warlike people, troubles that may\nappear are due to the absence of (an expansive and cultivated)\nterritory.\nPisuna says that of the troubles due to the absence of forts and\nto want of finance, troubles due to want of finance are more\nserious; the repair of fortifications and their maintenance depend\nupon finance; by means of wealth, intrigue to capture an enemy's\nfort may be carried on; by means of wealth, the people, friends, and\nenemies can be kept under control; by means of it, outsiders can be\nencouraged and the establishment of the army and its operations\nconducted. It is possible to remove the treasure in times of danger,\nbut not the fort.\nNo, says Kautilya, for it is in the fort that the treasury and the\narmy are safely kept, and it is from the fort that secret war\n(intrigue), control over one's partisans, the upkeep of the army, the\nreception of allies and the driving out of enemies and of wild tribes\nare successfully practised. In the absence of forts, the treasury is to\nthe enemy, for it seems that for those who own forts, there is no\ndestruction.\nKaunapadanta says that of distress due to want of finance or\nto an inefficient army, that which is due to the want of an efficient\narmy is more serious; for control over one's own friends and\nenemies, the winning over the army of an enemy, and the business\nof administration are all dependent upon the army. In the absence\nof the army, it is certain that the treasury will be lost, whereas lack\nof finance can be made up by procuring raw products and lands or\nby seizing an enemy's territory.\nThe army may go to the enemy, or murder the king himself,\n447",

Owing to a\nchange in place, time, and policy, either finance or the army may\nbe a superior power; for the army is (sometimes) the means of\nsecuring the wealth acquired; but wealth is (always) the means of\nsecuring both the treasury and the army. Since all activities are\ndependent upon finance, financial troubles are more serious.\nV\u00e1tavy\u00e1dhi says that of the distress of the army and of an ally,\nthe distress of an ally is more serious--an ally, though he is not fed\nand is far off, is still serviceable; he drives off not only the\nrear-enemy and the friends of the rear-enemy, but also the frontal\nenemy and wild tribes; he also helps his friend with money, army,\nand lands on occasions of troubles.\nNo, says Kautilya, the ally of him who has a powerful army\nkeeps the alliance; and even the enemy assumes a friendly attitude;\nwhen there is a work that can be equally accomplished either by the\narmy or by an ally, then preference to the army or to the ally should\ndepend on the advantages of securing the appropriate place and\ntime for war and the expected profit. In times of sudden expedition\nand on occasions of troubles from an enemy, a wild tribe, or local\nrebels, no friend can be trusted.

End of the hundred and\nseventeenth chapter from the beginning.]\nCHAPTER II. CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE\nTROUBLES OF THE KING AND OF HIS KINGDOM.\nTHE king and his kingdom are the primary elements of the\nstate.\nThe troubles of the king may be either internal or external.\nInternal troubles are more serious than external troubles which are\nlike the danger arising from a lurking snake. Troubles due to a\nminister are more serious than other kinds of internal troubles.\nHence, the king should keep under his own control the powers of\nfinance and the army.\nOf divided rule and foreign rule, divided rule or rule of a\ncountry by two kings, perishes owing to mutual hatred, partiality\nand rivalry. Foreign rule which comes into existence by seizing the\ncountry from its king still alive, thinks that the country is not its\nown, impoverishes it, and carries off its wealth, or treats it as a\ncommercial article; and when the country ceases to love it, it retires\nabandoning the country.\nWhich is better, a blind king, or a king erring against the\nscience?\n449",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nMy teacher says that a blind king, i.e., a king who is not\npossessed of an eye in sciences, is indiscriminate in doing works,\nvery obstinate, and is led by others; such a king destroys the\nkingdom by his own maladministration. But an erring king can be\neasily brought round when and where his mind goes astray from\nthe procedure laid down in sciences.\nNo, says Kautilya, a blind king can be made by his supporters\nto adhere to whatever line of policy he ought to. But an erring king\nwho is bent upon doing what is against the science, brings about\ndestruction to himself and his kingdom by maladministration.\nWhich is better, a diseased or a new king ?\nMy teacher says that a diseased king loses his kingdom owing\nto the intrigue of his ministers, or loses his life on account of the\nkingdom; but a new king pleases the people by such popular deeds\nas the observance of his own duties and the act of bestowing\nfavours, remissions (of taxes), gifts, and presents upon others.\nNo, says Kautilya, a diseased king continues to observe his\nduties as usual. But a new king begins to act as he pleases under the\nimpression that the country, acquired by his own might, belongs to\nhimself; when pressed by combined kings (for plunder), he\ntolerates their oppression of the country. Or having no firm control\nover the elements of the state, he is easily removed. There is this\ndifference among diseased kings: a king who is morally diseased,\nand a king who is suffering from physical disease; there is also this\ndifference among new kings: a high-born king and a base-born\nking.\nWhich is better, a weak but high-born king, or a strong but\nlow-born king?\n450",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nMy teacher says that a people, even if interested in having a\nweak king, hardly allow room for the intrigues of a weak but\nhigh-born person to be their king; but that if they desire power,\nthey will easily yield themselves to the intrigues of a strong but\nbase-born person to be their king.\nNo, says Kautilya, a people will naturally obey a high-born\nking though he is weak, for the tendency of a prosperous people is\nto follow a high-born king. Also they render the intrigues of a\nstrong but base-born person, unavailing, as the saying is, that\npossession of virtues makes for friendship.\nThe destruction of crops is worse than the destruction of\nhandfuls (of grains), since it is the labour that is destroyed thereby;\nabsence of rain is worse than too much rain.\n* The comparative seriousness or insignificance of any two\nkinds of troubles affecting the elements of sovereignty, in the order\nof enumeration of the several kinds of distress, is the cause of\nadopting offensive or defensive operations.\n[Thus ends Chapter II, \"Considerations about the Troubles of the\nKing and of his Kingdom,\u201d in Book VIII, \u201cConcerning Vices and\nCalamities,\u201d of the Arthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya. End of the hundred\nand eighteenth chapter from the beginning.]\nCHAPTER III. THE AGGREGATE OF THE TROUBLE OF\nMEN.\nIGNORANCE and absence of discipline are the causes of a\nman's troubles. An untrained man does not perceive the injuries\narising from vices. We are going to treat of them (vices):--\n451",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nVice's due to anger form a triad; and those due to desire are\nfourfold. Of these two, anger is worse, for anger proceeds against\nall. In a majority of cases, kings given to anger are said to have\nfallen a prey to popular fury. But kings addicted to pleasures have\nperished in consequence of serious diseases brought about by\ndeterioration and improverishment.\nNo, says Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1ja, anger is the characteristic of a\nrighteous man. It is the foundation of bravery; it puts an end to\ndespicable (persons); and it keeps the people under fear. Anger is\nalways a necessary quality for the prevention of sin. But desire\n(accompanies) the enjoyment of results, reconciliation, generosity,\nand the act of endearing oneself to all. Possession of desire is\nalways necessary for him who is inclined to enjoy the fruits of what\nhe has accomplished.\nNo, says Kautilya, anger brings about enmity with, and\ntroubles from, an enemy, and is always associated with pain.\nAddiction to pleasure (k\u00e1ma) occasions contempt and loss of\nwealth, and throws the addicted person into the company of\nthieves, gamblers, hunters, singers, players on musical\ninstruments, and other undesirable persons. Of these, enmity is\nmore serious than contempt, for a despised person is caught hold of\nby his own people and by his enemies, whereas a hated person is\ndestroyed. Troubles from an enemy are more serious than loss of\nwealth, for loss of wealth causes financial troubles, whereas\ntroubles from an enemy are injurious to life. Suffering on account\nof vices is more serious than keeping company with undesirable\npersons, for the company of undesirable persons can be got rid of\nin a moment, whereas suffering from vices causes injury for a long\ntime. Hence, anger is a more serious evil.\nWhich is worse: abuse of language, or of money, or\noppressive punishment?\n452",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nVis\u00e1l\u00e1ksha says that of abuse of language and of money,\nabuse of language is worse; for when harshly spoken to, a brave\nman retaliates; and bad language, like a nail piercing the heart,\nexcites anger and gives pain to the senses.\nNo, says Kautilya, gift of money palliates the fury occasioned\nby abusive language, whereas abuse of money causes the loss of\nlivelihood itself. Abuse of money means gifts, exaction, loss or\nabandonment of money.\nThe School of Par\u00e1sara say that of abuse of money and\noppressive punishment, abuse of money is worse; for good deeds\nand enjoyments depend upon wealth; the world itself is bound by\nwealth. Hence, its abuse is a more serious evil.\nNo, says Kautilya, in preference to a large amount of wealth,\nno man desires the loss of his own life. Owing to oppressive\npunishment, one is liable to the same punishment at the hands of\none's enemies.\nSuch is the nature of the triad of evils due to anger.\nThe fourfold vices due to desire are hunting, gambling,\nwomen and drinking.\nPisuna says that of hunting and gambling, hunting is a worse\nvice; for falling into the hand of robbers, enemies and elephants,\ngetting into wild fire, fear, inability to distinguish between the\ncardinal points, hunger, thirst and loss of life are evils consequent\nupon hunting, whereas in gambling, the expert gambler wins a\nvictory like Jayatsena and Duryodhana.\nNo, says Kautilya, of the two parties, one has to suffer from\ndefeat, as is well known from the history of Nala and Yudhishthira;\n453",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nthe same wealth that is won like a piece of flesh in gambling,\ncauses enmity. Lack of recognition of wealth properly acquired,\nacquisition of ill-gotten wealth, loss of wealth without enjoyment,\nstaying away from answering the calls of nature, and contracting\ndiseases from not taking timely meals, are the evils of gambling,\nwhereas in hunting, exercise, the disappearance of phlegm, bile,\nfat, and sweat, the acquisition of skill in aiming at stationary and\nmoving bodies, the ascertainment of the appearance of beasts when\nprovoked, and occasional march (are its good characteristics).\nKaunapadanta says that of addiction to gambling and to\nwomen, gambling is a more serious evil; for gamblers always play,\neven at night by lamp light, and even when the mother (of one of\nthe players) is dead; the gambler exhibits anger when spoken to in\ntimes of trouble; whereas in the case of addiction to women, it is\npossible to hold conversation about virtue and wealth, at the time\nof bathing, dressing and eating. Also it is possible to make, by\nmeans of secret punishment, a woman to be so good as to secure\nthe welfare of the king, or to get rid of her, or drive her out, under\nthe plea of disease.\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to divert the attention from\ngambling, but not so from women. (The evils of the latter are)\nfailure to see (what ought to be seen), violation of duty, the evil of\npostponing works that are to be immediately done, incapacity to\ndeal with politics, and contracting the evil of drinking.\nV\u00e1tavy\u00e1dhi says that of addiction to women and to drinking,\naddiction to women is a more serious evil: there are various kinds\nof childishness among women, as explained in the chapter on \u201eThe\nHarem,\u201f whereas in drinking, the enjoyment of sound and other\nobjects of the senses, pleasing other people, honouring the\nfollowers, and relaxation from the fatigue of work (are the\nadvantages).\n454",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nNo, says Kautilya, in the case of addiction to women, the\nconsequences are the birth of children, self-protection, change of\nwives in the harem, and absence of such consequences in the case\nof unworthy outside women. Both the above consequences follow\nfrom drinking. The auspicious effects of drinking are loss of\nmoney, lunacy in a sensate man, corpselike appearance while\nliving, nakedness, the loss of the knowledge of the Vedas, loss of\nlife, wealth, and friends, disassociation with the good, suffering\nfrom pain, and indulgence in playing on musical instruments and in\nsinging at the expense of wealth.\nOf gambling and drinking, gambling causes gain or loss of the\nstakes to one party or other. Even among dumb animals, it splits\nthem into factions and causes provocation. It is specially due to\ngambling that assemblies and royal confederacies possessing the\ncharacteristics of assemblies are split into factions, and are\nconsequently destroyed. The reception of what is condemned is the\nworst of all evils since it causes incapacity to deal with politics.\n* The reception of what is condemned is (due to) desire; and anger\nconsists in oppressing the good; since both these are productive of\nmany evils, both of them are held to be the worst evils.\n* Hence be who is possessed of discretion should associate with\nthe aged, and, after controlling his passions, abandon both anger\nand desire which are productive of other evils and destructive of\nthe very basis (of life).\n[Thus ends Chapter III, \"The Aggregate of the Troubles of Men,\"\nin Book VIII. \"Concerning Vices and Calamities\u201d of the\nArthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya.

THE GROUP OF MOLESTATIONS, THE\nGROUP OF OBSTRUCTIONS, AND THE GROUP OF\nFINANCIAL TROUBLES.\nPROVIDENTIAL calamities are fire, floods, pestilence,\nfamine, and (the epidemic disease called) maraka.\nMy teacher says that of fire and floods, destruction due to fire\nis irremediable; all kinds of troubles, except those due to fire, can\nbe alleviated, and troubles due to floods can be passed over.\nNo, says Kautilya, fire destroys a village, or part of a village\nwhereas floods carry off hundreds of villages.\nMy teacher says that of pestilence and famine, pestilence\nbrings all kinds of business to a stop by causing obstruction to work\non account of disease and death among men and owing to the flight\nof servants, whereas famine stops no work, but is productive of\ngold, cattle and taxes.\nNo, says Kautilya, pestilence devastates only a part (of the\ncountry) and can be remedied, whereas famine causes troubles to\nthe whole (of the country) and occasions dearth of livelihood to all\ncreatures.\nThis explains the consequences of maraka.\nMy teacher says that of the loss of chief and vulgar men, the\nloss of vulgar men causes obstruction to work.\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to recruit vulgar men, since\nthey form the majority of people; for the sake of vulgar men,\nnobles should not be allowed to perish; one in a thousand may or\nmay not be a noble man; he it is who is possessed of excessive\ncourage and wisdom and is the refuge of vulgar people.\n456",

In ministerial distress, the king's\nlife itself comes into danger, for a minister is the mainstay of the\nsecurity of the king's life.\nNo, says Kautilya, it is verily the king who attends to the\nbusiness of appointing ministers, priests, and other servants,\nincluding the superintendents of several departments, the\napplication of remedies against the troubles of his people, and of\nhis kingdom, and the adoption of progressive measures; when his\nministers fall into troubles, he employs others; he is ever ready to\nbestow rewards on the worthy and inflict punishments on the\nwicked; when the king is well off, by his welfare and prosperity, he\npleases the people; of what kind the king's character is, of the same\nkind will be the character of his people; for their progress or\ndownfall, the people depend upon the king; the king is, as it were,\nthe aggregate of the people.\nVis\u00e1l\u00e1ksha says that of the troubles of the minister and of the\npeople; the troubles of the people are more serious; finance, army,\nraw products, free labour, carriage of things, and collection (of\nnecessaries) are all secured from the people. There will be no such\nthings in the absence of people, next to the king and his minister.\nNo, says Kautilya, all activities proceed from the minister,\nactivities such as the successful accomplishment of the works of\nthe people, security of person and property from internal and\nexternal enemies, remedial measures against calamities,\ncolonization and improvement of wild tracts of land, recruiting the\narmy, collection of revenue, and bestowal of favour.\nThe school of Par\u00e1sara say that of the distress of the people\nand distress due to bad fortifications, the latter is a more serious\nevil; for it is in fortified towns that the treasury and the army are\n468",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nsecured; they (fortified towns) are a secure place for the people;\nthey are a stronger power than the citizens or country people; and\nthey are a powerful defensive instrument in times of danger for the\nking. As to the people, they are common both to the king and his\nenemy.\nNo, says Kautilya, for forts, finance, and the army depend\nupon the people; likewise buildings, trade, agricu1ture,\ncattle-rearing, bravery, stability, power, and abundance (of things).\nIn countries inhabited by people, there are mountains and islands\n(as natural forts); in the absence of an expansive country, forts are\nresorted to. When a country consists purely of cultivators, troubles\ndue to the absence of fortifications (are apparent); while in a\ncountry which consists purely of warlike people, troubles that may\nappear are due to the absence of (an expansive and cultivated)\nterritory.\nPisuna says that of the troubles due to the absence of forts and\nto want of finance, troubles due to want of finance are more\nserious; the repair of fortifications and their maintenance depend\nupon finance; by means of wealth, intrigue to capture an enemy's\nfort may be carried on; by means of wealth, the people, friends, and\nenemies can be kept under control; by means of it, outsiders can be\nencouraged and the establishment of the army and its operations\nconducted. It is possible to remove the treasure in times of danger,\nbut not the fort.\nNo, says Kautilya, for it is in the fort that the treasury and the\narmy are safely kept, and it is from the fort that secret war\n(intrigue), control over one's partisans, the upkeep of the army, the\nreception of allies and the driving out of enemies and of wild tribes\nare successfully practised. In the absence of forts, the treasury is to\nthe enemy, for it seems that for those who own forts, there is no\ndestruction.\n469",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nKaunapadanta says that of distress due to want of finance or\nto an inefficient army, that which is due to the want of an efficient\narmy is more serious; for control over one's own friends and\nenemies, the winning over the army of an enemy, and the business\nof administration are all dependent upon the army. In the absence\nof the army, it is certain that the treasury will be lost, whereas lack\nof finance can be made up by procuring raw products and lands or\nby seizing an enemy's territory.\nThe army may go to the enemy, or murder the king himself,\nand bring about all kinds of troubles. But finance is the chief means\nof observing virtuous acts and of enjoying desires. Owing to a\nchange in place, time, and policy, either finance or the army may\nbe a superior power; for the army is (sometimes) the means of\nsecuring the wealth acquired; but wealth is (always) the means of\nsecuring both the treasury and the army. Since all activities are\ndependent upon finance, financial troubles are more serious.\nV\u00e1tavy\u00e1dhi says that of the distress of the army and of an ally,\nthe distress of an ally is more serious--an ally, though he is not fed\nand is far off, is still serviceable; he drives off not only the\nrear-enemy and the friends of the rear-enemy, but also the frontal\nenemy and wild tribes; he also helps his friend with money, army,\nand lands on occasions of troubles.\nNo, says Kautilya, the ally of him who has a powerful army\nkeeps the alliance; and even the enemy assumes a friendly attitude;\nwhen there is a work that can be equally accomplished either by the\narmy or by an ally, then preference to the army or to the ally should\ndepend on the advantages of securing the appropriate place and\ntime for war and the expected profit. In times of sudden expedition\nand on occasions of troubles from an enemy, a wild tribe, or local\nrebels, no friend can be trusted. When calamities happen together,\nor when an enemy has grown strong, a friend keeps up his\n470",

Thus the\ndetermination of the comparative seriousness of the calamities of\nthe various elements of sovereignty.\n* When a part of one of the elements of sovereignty is under\ntroubles, the extent, affection, and strength of the serviceable part\ncan be the means of accomplishing a work.\n* When any two elements of sovereignty are equally under\ntroubles, they should be distinguished in respect of their\nprogressive or declining tendency, provided that the good\ncondition of the rest of the elements needs no description.\n* When the calamities of a single element tend to destroy the\nrest of the elements, those calamities, whether they be of the\nfundamental or any other element, are verily serious.\n[Thus ends Chapter I, \u201cThe Aggregate of the Calamities of the\nElements of Sovereignty,\u201d in Book VIII, \u201cConcerning Vices and\nCalamities\u201d of the Arthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya.

CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE\nTROUBLES OF THE KING AND OF HIS KINGDOM.\nTHE king and his kingdom are the primary elements of the\nstate.\nThe troubles of the king may be either internal or external.\nInternal troubles are more serious than external troubles which are\nlike the danger arising from a lurking snake. Troubles due to a\nminister are more serious than other kinds of internal troubles.\nHence, the king should keep under his own control the powers of\nfinance and the army.\n471",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nOf divided rule and foreign rule, divided rule or rule of a\ncountry by two kings, perishes owing to mutual hatred, partiality\nand rivalry. Foreign rule which comes into existence by seizing the\ncountry from its king still alive, thinks that the country is not its\nown, impoverishes it, and carries off its wealth, or treats it as a\ncommercial article; and when the country ceases to love it, it retires\nabandoning the country.\nWhich is better, a blind king, or a king erring against the\nscience?\nMy teacher says that a blind king, i.e., a king who is not\npossessed of an eye in sciences, is indiscriminate in doing works,\nvery obstinate, and is led by others; such a king destroys the\nkingdom by his own maladministration. But an erring king can be\neasily brought round when and where his mind goes astray from\nthe procedure laid down in sciences.\nNo, says Kautilya, a blind king can be made by his supporters\nto adhere to whatever line of policy he ought to. But an erring king\nwho is bent upon doing what is against the science, brings about\ndestruction to himself and his kingdom by maladministration.\nWhich is better, a diseased or a new king ?\nMy teacher says that a diseased king loses his kingdom owing\nto the intrigue of his ministers, or loses his life on account of the\nkingdom; but a new king pleases the people by such popular deeds\nas the observance of his own duties and the act of bestowing\nfavours, remissions (of taxes), gifts, and presents upon others.\nNo, says Kautilya, a diseased king continues to observe his\nduties as usual. But a new king begins to act as he pleases under the\nimpression that the country, acquired by his own might, belongs to\n472",

Or having no firm control\nover the elements of the state, he is easily removed. There is this\ndifference among diseased kings: a king who is morally diseased,\nand a king who is suffering from physical disease; there is also this\ndifference among new kings: a high-born king and a base-born\nking.\nWhich is better, a weak but high-born king, or a strong but\nlow-born king?\nMy teacher says that a people, even if interested in having a\nweak king, hardly allow room for the intrigues of a weak but\nhigh-born person to be their king; but that if they desire power,\nthey will easily yield themselves to the intrigues of a strong but\nbase-born person to be their king.\nNo, says Kautilya, a people will naturally obey a high-born\nking though he is weak, for the tendency of a prosperous people is\nto follow a high-born king. Also they render the intrigues of a\nstrong but base-born person, unavailing, as the saying is, that\npossession of virtues makes for friendship.\nThe destruction of crops is worse than the destruction of\nhandfuls (of grains), since it is the labour that is destroyed thereby;\nabsence of rain is worse than too much rain.\n* The comparative seriousness or insignificance of any two\nkinds of troubles affecting the elements of sovereignty, in the order\nof enumeration of the several kinds of distress, is the cause of\nadopting offensive or defensive operations.\n[Thus ends Chapter II, \"Considerations about the Troubles of the\nKing and of his Kingdom,\u201d in Book VIII, \u201cConcerning Vices and\n473",

THE AGGREGATE OF THE TROUBLE\nOF MEN.\nIGNORANCE and absence of discipline are the causes of a\nman's troubles. An untrained man does not perceive the injuries\narising from vices. We are going to treat of them (vices):--\nVice's due to anger form a triad; and those due to desire are\nfourfold. Of these two, anger is worse, for anger proceeds against\nall. In a majority of cases, kings given to anger are said to have\nfallen a prey to popular fury. But kings addicted to pleasures have\nperished in consequence of serious diseases brought about by\ndeterioration and improverishment.\nNo, says Bh\u00e1radv\u00e1ja, anger is the characteristic of a righteous\nman. It is the foundation of bravery; it puts an end to despicable\n(persons); and it keeps the people under fear. Anger is always a\nnecessary quality for the prevention of sin. But desire\n(accompanies) the enjoyment of results, reconciliation, generosity,\nand the act of endearing oneself to all. Possession of desire is\nalways necessary for him who is inclined to enjoy the fruits of what\nhe has accomplished.\nNo, says Kautilya, anger brings about enmity with, and\ntroubles from, an enemy, and is always associated with pain.\nAddiction to pleasure (k\u00e1ma) occasions contempt and loss of\nwealth, and throws the addicted person into the company of\nthieves, gamblers, hunters, singers, players on musical\ninstruments, and other undesirable persons. Of these, enmity is\nmore serious than contempt, for a despised person is caught hold of\nby his own people and by his enemies, whereas a hated person is\n474",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\ndestroyed. Troubles from an enemy are more serious than loss of\nwealth, for loss of wealth causes financial troubles, whereas\ntroubles from an enemy are injurious to life. Suffering on account\nof vices is more serious than keeping company with undesirable\npersons, for the company of undesirable persons can be got rid of\nin a moment, whereas suffering from vices causes injury for a long\ntime. Hence, anger is a more serious evil.\nWhich is worse: abuse of language, or of money, or\noppressive punishment?\nVis\u00e1l\u00e1ksha says that of abuse of language and of money,\nabuse of language is worse; for when harshly spoken to, a brave\nman retaliates; and bad language, like a nail piercing the heart,\nexcites anger and gives pain to the senses.\nNo, says Kautilya, gift of money palliates the fury occasioned\nby abusive language, whereas abuse of money causes the loss of\nlivelihood itself. Abuse of money means gifts, exaction, loss or\nabandonment of money.\nThe School of Par\u00e1sara say that of abuse of money and\noppressive punishment, abuse of money is worse; for good deeds\nand enjoyments depend upon wealth; the world itself is bound by\nwealth. Hence, its abuse is a more serious evil.\nNo, says Kautilya, in preference to a large amount of wealth,\nno man desires the loss of his own life. Owing to oppressive\npunishment, one is liable to the same punishment at the hands of\none's enemies.\nSuch is the nature of the triad of evils due to anger.\n475",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nThe fourfold vices due to desire are hunting, gambling,\nwomen and drinking.\nPisuna says that of hunting and gambling, hunting is a worse\nvice; for falling into the hand of robbers, enemies and elephants,\ngetting into wild fire, fear, inability to distinguish between the\ncardinal points, hunger, thirst and loss of life are evils consequent\nupon hunting, whereas in gambling, the expert gambler wins a\nvictory like Jayatsena and Duryodhana.\nNo, says Kautilya, of the two parties, one has to suffer from\ndefeat, as is well known from the history of Nala and Yudhishthira;\nthe same wealth that is won like a piece of flesh in gambling,\ncauses enmity. Lack of recognition of wealth properly acquired,\nacquisition of ill-gotten wealth, loss of wealth without enjoyment,\nstaying away from answering the calls of nature, and contracting\ndiseases from not taking timely meals, are the evils of gambling,\nwhereas in hunting, exercise, the disappearance of phlegm, bile,\nfat, and sweat, the acquisition of skill in aiming at stationary and\nmoving bodies, the ascertainment of the appearance of beasts when\nprovoked, and occasional march (are its good characteristics).\nKaunapadanta says that of addiction to gambling and to\nwomen, gambling is a more serious evil; for gamblers always play,\neven at night by lamp light, and even when the mother (of one of\nthe players) is dead; the gambler exhibits anger when spoken to in\ntimes of trouble; whereas in the case of addiction to women, it is\npossible to hold conversation about virtue and wealth, at the time\nof bathing, dressing and eating. Also it is possible to make, by\nmeans of secret punishment, a woman to be so good as to secure\nthe welfare of the king, or to get rid of her, or drive her out, under\nthe plea of disease.\n476",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to divert the attention from\ngambling, but not so from women. (The evils of the latter are)\nfailure to see (what ought to be seen), violation of duty, the evil of\npostponing works that are to be immediately done, incapacity to\ndeal with politics, and contracting the evil of drinking.\nV\u00e1tavy\u00e1dhi says that of addiction to women and to drinking,\naddiction to women is a more serious evil: there are various kinds\nof childishness among women, as explained in the chapter on \u201eThe\nHarem,\u201f whereas in drinking, the enjoyment of sound and other\nobjects of the senses, pleasing other people, honouring the\nfollowers, and relaxation from the fatigue of work (are the\nadvantages).\nNo, says Kautilya, in the case of addiction to women, the\nconsequences are the birth of children, self-protection, change of\nwives in the harem, and absence of such consequences in the case\nof unworthy outside women. Both the above consequences follow\nfrom drinking. The auspicious effects of drinking are loss of\nmoney, lunacy in a sensate man, corpselike appearance while\nliving, nakedness, the loss of the knowledge of the Vedas, loss of\nlife, wealth, and friends, disassociation with the good, suffering\nfrom pain, and indulgence in playing on musical instruments and in\nsinging at the expense of wealth.\nOf gambling and drinking, gambling causes gain or loss of\nthe stakes to one party or other. Even among dumb animals, it splits\nthem into factions and causes provocation. It is specially due to\ngambling that assemblies and royal confederacies possessing the\ncharacteristics of assemblies are split into factions, and are\nconsequently destroyed. The reception of what is condemned is the\nworst of all evils since it causes incapacity to deal with politics.\n477",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\n* The reception of what is condemned is (due to) desire; and\nanger consists in oppressing the good; since both these are\nproductive of many evils, both of them are held to be the worst\nevils.\n* Hence be who is possessed of discretion should associate\nwith the aged, and, after controlling his passions, abandon both\nanger and desire which are productive of other evils and\ndestructive of the very basis (of life).\n[Thus ends Chapter III, \"The Aggregate of the Troubles of Men,\"\nin Book VIII. \"Concerning Vices and Calamities\u201d of the\nArthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya.

        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nNo, says Kautilya, pestilence devastates only a part (of the\ncountry) and can be remedied, whereas famine causes troubles to\nthe whole (of the country) and occasions dearth of livelihood to all\ncreatures.\nThis explains the consequences of maraka.\nMy teacher says that of the loss of chief and vulgar men, the\nloss of vulgar men causes obstruction to work.\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to recruit vulgar men, since\nthey form the majority of people; for the sake of vulgar men,\nnobles should not be allowed to perish; one in a thousand may or\nmay not be a noble man; he it is who is possessed of excessive\ncourage and wisdom and is the refuge of vulgar people.\nMy teacher says that of the troubles arising from one's own or\none\u201fs enemy's Circle of States, those due to one's own Circle are\ndoubly injurious and are irremediable, whereas an inimical Circle\nof States can be fought out or kept away by the intervention of an\nally or by making peace.\nNo, says Kautilya, troubles due to one's own Circle can be got\nrid of by arresting or destroying the leaders among the subjective\npeople; or they may be injurious to a part of the country, whereas\ntroubles due to an enemy's Circle of States cause oppression by\ninflicting loss and destruction and by burning, devastation, and\nplunder.\nMy teacher says that of the quarrels among the people and\namong kings, quarrel among the people brings about disunion and\nthereby enables an enemy to invade the country, whereas quarrel\namong kings is productive of double pay and wages and of\nremission of taxes to the people.\n479",

CONSIDERATION ABOUT LOSS OF MEN,\nWEALTH, AND PROFIT.\nLoss of trained men is what is called kshaya, loss of men.\nDiminution of gold and grains is loss of wealth.\nWhen the expected profit overweighs both these; then one\nshould march (against an enemy).\nThe characteristics of an expected profit are: that which is\nreceivable, that which is to be returned, that which pleases all, that\nwhich excites hatred, that which is realised in a short time, that\nwhich entails little loss of men to earn, that which entails little loss\nof wealth to earn, that which is vast, that which is productive, that\nwhich is harmless, that which is just, and that which comes first.\nWhen a profit is easily acquired and secured without the\nnecessity of returning it to others, it is termed \u201ereceivable\u201f; that\nwhich is of the reverse nature is \u201erepayable\u201f; whoever goes to\nreceive a repayable profit or is enjoying it gets destruction.\nWhen he, however, thinks that \"by taking a repayable profit I\nshall cause my enemy\u201fs treasury, army, and other defensive\nresources to dwindle; I shall exploit to impoverishment the mines,\ntimber and elephant forests, irrigational works and roads of traffic\nof my enemy; I shall impoverish his subjects, or cause them to\nmigrate, or conspire against him; when they are reduced to this\ncondition, my enemy inflames their hatred (by punishing them); or\nI shall set my enemy against another enemy; my enemy will give\nup his hopes and run away to one who has some blood-relationship\n503",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nwith him; or having improved his lands, I shall return them to him,\nand when he is thus brought to ascendancy, he will be a lasting\nfriend of mine,\"--then he may take even a repayable profit. Thus\nreceivable and repayable profits are explained.\nThat profit which a virtuous king receives from a wicked king\npleases both his own and other people; that which is of the reverse\nnature excites hatred; that profit which is received at the advice of\nministers excites hatred, for they think: \u201eThis king has reduced our\nparty and impoverished us.\" That profit which is received without\ncaring for the opinion of treacherous ministers excites hatred, for\nthey think: \"Having made the profit, this king destroys us.\" But that\nwhich is of the reverse nature pleases. Thus pleasing and\nprovoking profits are explained.\nThat which is acquired by mere marching is what is acquired\nsoon.\nThat which is to be realised by negotiation (mantras\u00e1ddhya)\nentails little loss of men.\nThat which requires merely the expenditure of provisions (for\nservants employed to earn it) entails little loss of wealth.\nThat which is immediately of considerable value is vast.\nThat which is the source of wealth is productive.\nThat which is attained with no troubles is harmless.\nThat which is acquired best is just.\nThat which is acquired without any hindrance from allies is\nprofit coming first.\n504",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nWhen profits (from two sources) are equal, he should\nconsider the place and time, the strength and means (required to\nacquire it), affection and disaffection (caused by it), intrigue and\nabsence of intrigue (involving it), its nearness and distance, its\npresent and future effects, its constant worth or worthlessness, and\nits plentifulness and usefulness; and he should accept only that\nprofit which is possessed of most of the above good characteristics.\nObstructions to profit are: passion, anger, timidity, mercy,\nbashfulness, living like one who is not an Arya, haughtiness, pity,\ndesire for the other world, strict adherence to virtuous life,\ndeception, neediness, envy, negligence of what is at hand,\ngenerosity, want of faith, fear, inability to endure cold, heat, and\nrain, and faith in the auspiciousness of lunar days and stars.\n*Wealth will pass away from that childish man who inquires\nmost after the stars; for wealth is the star for wealth; what will the\nstars do?\n*Capable men will certainly secure wealth at least after a\nhundred trials; and wealth is bound by wealth just as elephants are\nbound by counter-elephants.\n[Thus ends Chapter IV, \u201cConsideration about Loss of Men, Wealth\nand Profit,\u201f in Book IX, \u201cThe Work of an Invader,\u201d of the\nArthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya.

        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nthan they ought to have been made is impolicy. From it arise\ndangers.\nThe various kinds of dangers are: that which is of external\norigin and of internal abetment; that which is of internal origin and\nof external abetment; that which is of external origin and of\nexternal abetment; and that which is of internal origin and of\ninternal abetment.\nWhere foreigners carry on an intrigue with local men or local\nmen with foreigners, there the consequence of the intrigue carried\non by the combination of local and foreign persons will be very\nserious. Abettors of an intrigue have a better chance of success than\nits originators; for when the originators of an intrigue are put down,\nothers will hardly succeed in undertaking any other intrigue.\nForeigners can hardly win over local persons by intrigue; nor can\nlocal men seduce foreigners. Foreigners will find their vast efforts\nafter all unavailing, and only conducive, to the prosperity of the\nking (against whom they want to conspire).\nWhen local persons are abetting (with foreigners), the means\nto be employed to suppress them are conciliation (s\u00e1ma) and gifts\n(d\u00e1na).\nThe act of pleasing a man with a high rank and honour is\nconciliation; favour and remission of taxes or employment to\nconduct state-works is what is termed gifts.\nWhen foreigners are abetting, the king should employ the\npolicy of dissension and coercion. Spies under the guise of friends\nmay inform foreigners: \"Mind, this man is desirous of deceiving\nyou with the help of his own spies who are disguised as traitors.\"\nSpies under the garb of traitors may mix with traitors and separate\nthem from foreigners, or foreigners from local traitors. Fiery spies\nmay make friendship with traitors and kill them with weapons or\n506",

Hence,\nwhen foreigners carry on an intrigue, the king should employ the\npolicy of dissension and coercion. Spies under the guise of friends\nmay inform foreign conspirators: \"Mind, this your king, with the\ndesire of enriching himself, is naturally provoked against you all.\"\nThen fiery spies may mix with the servants and soldiers of the\nabettor (of foreign conspirators) and kill them with weapons,\npoison, and other means. Other spies may then expose or betray the\nabettor.\nWhen local men carry on an intrigue with local men, the king\nshould employ necessary strategic means to put it down. He may\nemploy the policy of conciliation with regard to those who keep the\nappearance of contentment, or who are naturally discontented or\notherwise. Gifts may be given under the pretext of having been\nsatisfied with a favoured man's steadfastness in maintaining the\npurity of his character, or under the plea of anxious care about his\nweal or woe. A spy under the garb of a friend may tell the local\npersons: \u201eYour king is attempting to find your heart; you should\ntell him the truth.\" Or local men may be separated from each other,\nby telling them: \"This man carries such a tale to the king against\nyou.\" And coercive measures may be employed as described in the\nChapter on \"Awards of Punishments.\"\nOf these four kinds of danger, internal danger should first be\ngot rid of; for it has been already stated that internal troubles like\nthe fear from a lurking snake are more serious than external\ntroubles.\n507",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\n* One must consider that of these four kinds of danger, that\nwhich is mentioned first is less grave than the one subsequently\nmentioned, whether or not it is caused by powerful persons;\notherwise (i.e., when the danger is caused by insignificant\npersons), simple means may be used to get rid of it.\n[Thus ends Chapter V, \"External and Internal Dangers\" in Book\nIX, \"The Work of an Invader,\u201d of the Arthas\u00e1stra of Kautilya. End\nof the hundred and twenty-sixth chapter from the beginning.]\nCHAPTER VI. PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH TRAITORS\nAND ENEMIES\nTHERE are two kinds of innocent persons, those who have\ndisassociated themselves from traitors and those who have kept\nthemselves away from enemies.\nIn order to separate citizens and country-people from traitors,\nthe king should employ all the strategic means, except coercion. It\nis very difficult to inflict punishment on an assembly of influential\nmen; and if inflicted at all, it may not produce the desired effect,\nbut may give rise to undesirable consequences. He may, however,\ntake steps against the leaders of the seditious as shown in the\nchapter on \"Awards of Punishments.\"\nIn order to separate his people from an enemy, he should\nemploy conciliation and other strategic means to frustrate the\nattempt of those who are the enemy's principal agents or by whom\nthe enemy's work is to be carried out.\nSuccess in securing the services of capable agents depends\n508",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nupon the king; success of efforts depends upon ministers; and\nsuccess to be achieved through capable agents is, therefore,\ndependent both upon the king and his ministers.\nWhen, in spite of the combination of traitors and loyal\npersons, success is achieved, it is mixed success; when people are\nthus mixed, success is to be achieved through the agency of loyal\npersons; for in the absence of a support, nothing that requires a\nsupport for its existence can exist. When success is involved in the\nunion of friends and enemies it is termed a success contaminated\nby an enemy; when success is contaminated by an enemy, it is to be\nachieved through the agency of a friend; for it is easy to attain\nsuccess through a friend, but not through an enemy.\nWhen a friend does not come to terms, intrigue should be\nfrequently resorted to. Through the agency of spies, the friend\nshould be won over after separating him from the enemy. Or\nattempts may be made to win him over who is the last among\ncombined friends; for when he who is the last among combined\nfriends is secured, those who occupy the middle rank will be\nseparated from each other; or attempts may be made to win over a\nfriend who occupies middle rank; for when a friend occupying\nmiddle rank among combined kings is secured, friends, occupying\nthe extreme ranks cannot keep the union. (In brief) all those\nmeasures which tend to break their combination should be\nemployed.\nA virtuous king may be conciliated by praising his birth,\nfamily, learning and character, and by pointing out the relationship\nwhich his ancestors had (with the proposer of peace), or by\ndescribing the benefits and absence of enmity shown to him.\nOr a king who is of good intentions, or who has lost his\nenthusiastic spirits, or whose strategic means are all exhausted and\n509",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nthwarted in a number of wars, or who has lost his men and wealth,\nor who has suffered from sojourning abroad, or who is desirous of\ngaining a friend in good faith, or who is apprehensive of danger\nfrom another, or who cares more for friendship than anything else,\nmay be won over by conciliation.\nOr a king who is greedy or who has lost his men may be won\nover by giving gifts through the medium of ascetics and chiefs who\nhave been previously kept with him for the purpose.\nGifts are of five kinds: abandonment of what is to be paid;\ncontinuance of what is being given; repayment of what is received;\npayment of one's own wealth; and help for a voluntary raid on the\nproperty of others.\nWhen any two kings are apprehensive of enmity and seizure\nof land from each other, seeds of dissension may be sown between\nthem. The timid of the two may be threatened with destruction and\nmay be told: \"Having made peace with you, this king works against\nyou; the friend of this other king is permitted to make an open\npeace.\"\nWhen from one's own country or from another's country\nmerchandise or commodities for manufacture in a manufactory are\ngoing to an enemy's country, spies may spread the information that\nthose commodities are obtained from one whom the enemy wanted\nto march against. When commodities are thus gathered in\nabundance (the owner of the articles) may send a message to the\nenemy: \"These commodities and merchandise are sent by me to\nyou; please declare war against the combined kings or desert them;\nyou will then get the rest of the tribute.\" Then spies may inform the\nother kings of the combination; \"These articles are given to him by\nyour enemy.\"\n510",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nThe conqueror may gather some merchandise peculiar to his\nenemy's country and unknown elsewhere. Spies, under the garb of\nmerchants, may sell that merchandise to other important enemies\nand tell them that that merchandise was given (to the conqueror) by\nthe enemy (whose country's product it is).\nOr having pleased with wealth and honour those who are\nhighly treacherous (among an enemy's people), the conqueror may\ncause them to live with the enemy, armed with weapons, poison\nand fire. One of the ministers of the enemy may be killed. His sons\nand wife may be induced to say that the minister was killed at night\n(by such and such a person). Then the enemy's minister may ask\nevery one of the family of the murdered minister (as to the cause of\nthe death). If they say in reply as they are told, they may be caused\nto be set free; if they do not do so, they may be caused to be caught\nhold of. Whoever has gained the confidence of the king may tell\nthe king (the enemy) that he (the enemy) has to guard his own\nperson from such and such a minister. Then the recipient of salaries\nfrom the two states (the conqueror's and the enemy's state) may\ninform the suspected minister to destroy (the king).\nOr such kings as are possessed of enthusiasm and power may\nbe told: \"Seize the country of this king, our treaty of peace standing\nas before.\" Then spies should inform the particular king of the\nattempt of these kings and cause the destruction of the\ncommissariat and of the followers of one of these kings. Other\nspies, pretending to be friends, should inform these kings of the\nnecessity of destroying the particular king.\nWhen an enemy's brave soldier, elephant, or horse dies, or is\nkilled, or carried off by spies, other spies may tell the enemy that\nthe death is due to mutual conflict among his followers. The man\nwho is employed to commit such murders may be asked to repeat\nhis work again on the condition of his receiving the balance due to\n511",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nhim. He should receive the amount from the recipient of salaries\nfrom two states; when the king's party is thus divided, some may be\nwon over (to the side of the conqueror).\nThis explains the case of the commander-in-chief, the prince,\nand the officers of the army (of the enemy).\nLikewise seeds of dissension may be sown among combined\nstates. Thus the work of sowing the seeds of dissension.\nSpies under concealment may, without the help of a fiery spy,\nmurder by means of weapons, poison or other things a fortified\nenemy who is of mean character or who is under troubles; any one\nof hidden spies may do the work when it is found easy; or a fiery\nspy alone may do the work by means of weapons, poison or fire;\nfor a fiery spy can do what others require all the necessary aids to\ndo.\nThus the four forms of strategic means.\nOf these means, that which comes first in the order of\nenumeration is, as stated in connection with \"invaders,\" easier than\nthe rest. Conciliation is of single quality; gift is two-fold, since\nconciliation precedes it; dissension is threefold, since conciliation\nand gift precede it; and conciliatory coercion is fourfold, since\nconciliation, gift, and dissension precede it.\nThe same means are employed in the case of local enemies,\ntoo; the difference is this: the chief messengers known to the\nmanufactories may be sent to any one of the local enemies in order\nto employ him for the purpose of making a treaty or for the purpose\nof destroying another person. When he agrees to the proposal, the\nmessengers should inform (their master) of their success. Then\nrecipients of salaries from two states should inform the people or\n512",

        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nINTENSITY of desire and other passions provoke one's own\npeople; impolicy provokes external enemies. Both these are the\ncharacteristics of demoniac life. Anger disturbs the feelings of\none's own men. Those causes which are conducive to the\nprosperity of one's enemy are dangerous wealth, provocative\nwealth, and wealth of doubtful consequences.\nWealth which, when obtained, increases the enemy's\nprosperity, or which, though obtained, is repayable to the enemy,\nor which causes loss of men and money, is dangerous wealth; for\nexample, wealth which is enjoyed in common by neighbouring\nkings and which is acquired at their expense; or wealth which is\nasked for by an enemy; or wealth which is seized like one's own\nproperty; or wealth which is acquired in the front and which causes\nfuture troubles or provokes an enemy in the rear; or wealth which is\nobtained by destroying a friend or by breaking a treaty and which is\ntherefore detested by the Circle of States--all these are the varieties\nof dangerous wealth.\nWealth which causes fear from one's own people or from an\nenemy is provocative wealth.\nWhen, in connection with these two kinds of wealth, there\narise doubts, such as: \"Is it provocative wealth or not? Harmless\nwealth or provocative wealth? First provocative and then\nharmless? Is it profitable to encourage an enemy or a friend?\nWould the bestowal of wealth and honour on an enemy's army\nexcite hatred or not?\"--of these doubts, doubt regarding the\nacquirement of wealth is preferable to (doubts regarding harm or\nprovocation).\nWealth productive of wealth; wealth productive of nothing;\nwealth productive of harm; loss or harm productive of wealth;\nsustenance of harm for no profit; harm productive of harm--these\nare the six varieties of harmful wealth.\n514",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nDestruction of an enemy in the front resulting in the\ndestruction of an enemy in the rear is what is termed \"wealth\nproductive of wealth.\"\nWealth acquired by helping a neutral king with the army is\nwhat is called \"wealth productive of nothing.\"\nThe reduction of the internal strength of an enemy is \"wealth\nproductive of harm.\"\nHelping the neighbouring king of an enemy with men and\nmoney is \"harm productive of wealth.\"\nWithdrawal after encouraging or setting a king of poor\nresources (against another) is \"harm productive of nothing.\"\nInactivity after causing excitement to a superior king is\n\"harm productive of harm.\"\nOf these, it is better to pursue that which is mentioned first in\nthe order of enumeration than that which is subsequently\nmentioned. Thus the procedure of setting to work.\nWhen the surrounding circumstances are conducive to\nwealth, it is known as wealth from all sides.\nWhen the acquirement of wealth from all sides is obstructed\nby an enemy in the rear, it takes the form of dangerous wealth\ninvolved in doubts.\nIn these two cases, success can be achieved by securing the\nhelp of a friend and the enemy of the rear-enemy.\nWhen there is reason to apprehend fear from enemies on all\n515",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nsides, it is a dangerous trouble; when a friend comes forward to\navert this fear, that trouble becomes involved in doubt. In these two\ncases, success can be achieved by securing the support of a\nnomadic enemy and the enemy of the rear-enemy.\nWhen the prospect of acquiring profit from one or the other\nside is irremediably obstructed by enemies, it is called \"dangerous\nwealth.\" In this case as well as in the case of profit from all sides,\none should undertake to march for acquiring profitable wealth.\nWhen the prospects of getting wealth (from two sides) are equal,\none should march to secure that which is important, near, unfailing,\nand obtainable by easy means.\nWhen there is the apprehension of harm from one quarter as\nwell as from another, it is wealth beset with danger from two sides.\nIn this case as well as in the case of wealth involved in danger from\nall sides, success is to be desired with the help of friends. In the\nabsence of friends, he should attempt to ward off harm from one\nside with the help of an ally who can be easily won over; he should\nward off harm from two sides with help of an ally of superior\npower; and he should ward off harm from all sides with all the\nresources he can command. When it is impossible to do this, he\nshould run away, leaving all that belongs to him; for if he lives, his\nreturn to power is certain as in the case of Suy\u00e1tra and Udayana.\nWhen there is the prospect of wealth from one side and the\napprehension of an attack from another, it is termed a situation\nbeset with wealth and harm. In this case, he should march to\nacquire that wealth which will enable him to ward off the attack;\notherwise he should attempt to avert the attack. This explains the\nsituation which is beset with wealth and harm on all sides.\nWhen there is the apprehension of harm from one side and\nwhen the prospect of acquiring wealth from another side is\ninvolved in doubt, it is termed doubt of harm and wealth from two\n516",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nsides. In this, he should ward off the harm first; when this is done,\nhe should attempt to acquire the doubtful wealth. This explains the\ndoubtful situation of harm and wealth from all sides.\nWhen there is the prospect of wealth from one side and the\napprehension of doubtful harm from another, it is a doubtful\nsituation of harm and wealth from two sides. This explains the\nsituation of doubtful harm and wealth from all sides. In this, he\nshould attempt to ward off the doubts of harm against each of the\nelements of his sovereignty in order; for it is better to leave a friend\nunder circumstances of doubtful harm, than the army; also the\narmy may be left under circumstances of doubtful harm, but not the\ntreasury. When all the elements of his sovereignty cannot be\nrelieved from harm, he should attempt to relieve some of them at\nleast. Among the elements, he should attempt to relieve first those\nanimate elements which are most loyal, and free from firebrands\nand greedy men; of inanimate elements (he should relieve) that\nwhich is most precious and useful. Such elements as are capable of\neasy relief may be relieved by such means as an agreement of\npeace, observance of neutrality, and making peace with one and\nwaging war with another. Those which require greater efforts may\nbe relieved by other means.\nOf deterioration, stagnation and progress, he should attempt\nto secure that which is mentioned later in the order of enumeration;\nor in the reverse order, if he finds that deterioration and other\nstages are conducive to future prosperity. Thus the determination\nof situations. This explains the situation of doubtful harm and\nwealth in the middle or at the close of a march.\nSince doubts of wealth and harm are constantly associated\nwith all expeditions, it is better to secure wealth by which it is easy\nto destroy an enemy in the rear and his allies, to recoup the loss of\nmen and money, to make provisions during the time of sojourning\n517",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nabroad, to make good what is repayable, and to defend the state.\nAlso harm or doubtful prospects of wealth in one's own state are\nalways intolerable.\nThis explains the situation of doubtful harm in the middle of\nan expedition. But at the close of an expedition, it is better to\nacquire wealth either by reducing or destroying a reducible or\nassailable enemy than to get into a situation of doubtful harm, lest\nenemies might cause troubles. But, for one who is not the leader of\ncombination of states, it is better to risk the situation of doubtful\nwealth or harm in the middle or at the close of an expedition, since\none is not obliged to continue the expedition.\nWealth, virtue, and enjoyment form the aggregate of the three\nkinds of wealth. Of these, it is better to secure that which is\nmentioned first than that which is subsequently mentioned in the\norder of enumeration.\nHarm, sin and grief form the aggregate, of the three kinds of\nharm. Of these, it is better to provide against that which is\nmentioned first, than that which is subsequently mentioned.\nWealth or harm, virtue or sin, and enjoyment or grief, are the\naggregate of the three kinds of doubts. Of these, it is better to try\nthat which is mentioned first than that which is mentioned later in\nthe order of enumeration, and which it is certain to shake off. Thus\nthe determination of opportunities. Thus ends the discourse on\ndanger.\nRegarding success in these dangerous situations and times: in\nthe case of troubles from sons, brothers or relatives, it is better to\nsecure relief by means of conciliation and gifts; in the case of\ntroubles from citizens, country people, or chiefs of the army, it is\nby means of gifts and sowing the seeds of dissension; in the case of\n518",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\ntroubles from a neighbouring king or wild tribes, it is by means of\nsowing the seeds of dissension and coercion. This is following the\norder of the means. In other kinds of situations, the same means\nmay be employed in the reverse order.\nSuccess against friends and enemies is always achieved by\ncomplicated means; for strategic means help each other. In the case\nof suspected ministers of an enemy, the employment of\nconciliation does not need the use of the other means; in the case of\ntreacherous ministers it is by means of gifts; in the case of\ncombination of states, it is by means of sowing the seeds of\ndissension; and in the case of the powerful, it is by means of\ncoercion.\nWhen grave and light dangers are together apprehended, a\nparticular means, or alternative means or all the means may be\nemployed.\nBy this alone, but not by any other means, is what is meant\nby a particular means.\nBy this or that, is what is meant by alternative means.\nBy this as well as by that, is what is meant by all the means.\nOf these, the single means as well as the combination of any\nthree means are four; the combinations of any two means are six;\nand the combination of all the four is one. Thus there are fifteen\nkinds of strategic means. Of the same number are the means in the\nreverse order.\nWhen a king attains success by only one means among these\nvarious means, he is called one of single success; when by two, one\nof double success; when by three, one of treble success; and when\nby four, one of four-fold success.\n519",

He should also make oblations into the fire\npronouncing the mantras of the Atharvaveda, and cause prayers to\nbe offered for the good of the victors as well as of those who attain\nto heaven by dying in the battle-field.

Having detached the flower of the\narmy and kept it on a favourable position not visible (to the\nenemy), the commander-in-chief and the leader should array the\nrest of the army. The infantry should be arrayed such that the space\n532",
        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nbetween any two men is a sama (14 angulas); cavalry with three\nsamas; chariots with four samas; and elephants with twice or thrice\nas much space (as between any two chariots). With such an array\nfree to move and having no confusion, one should fight. A bow\nmeans five aratnis (5 x 54 = 120 angulas). Archers should be\nstationed at the distance of five bows (from one line to another); the\ncavalry at the distance of three bows; and chariots or elephants at\nthe distance of five bows.\nThe intervening space (an\u00edkasandhi) between wings, flanks\nand front of the army should be five bows. There must be three men\nto oppose a horse (pratiyoddha); fifteen men or five horses to\noppose a chariot or an elephant; and as many (fifteen) servants (\np\u00e1dagopa) for a horse, a chariot and an elephant should be\nmaintained.\nThree groups (an\u00edka) of three chariots each should be\nstationed in front; the same number on the two flanks and the two\nwings. Thus, in an array of chariots, the number of chariots\namounts to forty-five, two hundred and twenty-five horses, six\nhundred and seventy-five men, and as many servants to attend\nupon the horses, chariots and elephants--this is called an even array\nof troops. The number of chariots in this array (of three groups of\nthree chariots each) may be increased by two and two till the\nincreased number amounts to twenty-one. Thus, this array of odd\nnumbers of chariots gives rise to ten odd varieties. Thus the surplus\nof the army may therefore be distributed in the above manner.\nTwo-thirds of the (surplus) chariots may be added to the flanks and\nthe wings, the rest being put in front. Thus the added surplus of\nchariots should be one-third less (than the number added to the\nflanks and wings). This explains the distribution of surplus\nelephants and horses. As many horses, chariots, and elephants may\nbe added as occasion no confusion in fighting.\n533",

The array in which the\nfront is occupied by elephants, the flanks by chariots, and the\nwings by horses is an array which can break the centre of the\nenemy's army; the reverse of this can harass the extremities of the\nenemy's army. An array of elephants may also be made: the front\nby such elephants as are trained for war; the flanks by such as are\ntrained for riding; and the wings by rogue elephants. In an array of\nhorses, the front by horses with mail armour; and the flanks and\nwings by horses without armour.

        "Kautilya's Arthashastra\nSuch statement, as \u201ehe says thus,\u201f is a quotation; for example:\n\"The school of Manu say that a king should make his assembly of\nministers consist of twelve ministers; the school of Brihaspati say\nthat it should consist of sixteen ministers; the school of Usans say it\nshould contain twenty members; but Kautilya holds that it should\ncontain as many ministers as the need of the kingdom requires.\u201d\nWhen a rule dwelt upon in connection with a question is said\nto apply to another question also, it is termed application; for\nexample: \"What is said of a debt not repaid holds good with failure\nto make good a promised gift.\"\nEstablishing a fact by what is to be treated of later on is \u201eplace\nof reference;\u201f for example: \"By making use of such strategic means\nas conciliation, bribery, dissension, and coercion, as we shall\nexplain in connection with calamities.\"\nProving an unseen thing or course of circumstances by what\nhas been seen is simile; for example: \"Like a father his son, he\nshould protect those of his subjects who have passed the period of\nthe remission of taxes.\"\nWhat naturally follows from a statement of facts, though not\nspoken of in plain terms, is implication; for example, \"Whoever\nhas full experience of the affairs of this world should, through the\nmedium of the courtiers and other friends, win the favour of a king\nwho is of good character and worthy sovereign. It follows from this\nthat no one should seek the favour of a king through the medium of\nthe king's enemies.\"\nWhen the statement of a reason is equally applicable to two\ncases of circumstances, it is termed doubt; for example: \"Which of\nthe two should a conqueror march against: one whose subjects are\nimpoverished and greedy, or one whose subjects are oppressed?\"\n609",
